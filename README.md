This is the source for the [BOLT80][] website.

It is statically generated using [PieCrust][], and since it also contains the
documentation for [PieCrust][], along with a few other things, it's a good
example for people who are looking to learn by example. If you spot a mistake in
the [PieCrust][] documentation, it's also easy to get it fixed by sending me a
pull request.
