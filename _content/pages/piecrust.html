[PieCrust][] is a very lightweight <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> that's all managed with text files. No complex setup, no databases, no administrative panels. But **PieCrust** is also a static website generator, where you can transform all you content into plain HTML files.


Features
--------
* Super-simple authoring: it's all just text files!
* Can generate a completely static website that will run with minimum resources for maximum scalability.
* Dynamic stuff can be handled with **Javascript** and other client-side processing.
* Comments can be handled by 3rd party services like [Disqus][].
* Your whole website can be easily stored in a revision control system.
* Rapid-iteration authoring: even if you use **PieCrust** as a static site generator, you can temporarily switch your website back to dynamic generation for instant preview (no need to way for the site to be regenerated!)

Requirements
------------
[PieCrust][] only requires a web-server running [PHP 5.3+][php] for dynamically rendered websites. If you "[bake]" your website, however, all you need is a web-server that can serve HTML files (and that's by definition _any_ web server)! You can't make it simpler (although of course you'll need some computer with PHP somewhere to do the baking in the first place).
