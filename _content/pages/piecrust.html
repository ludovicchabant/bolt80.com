in less than a few milliseconds in most cases. It means that previewing or generating
your website is super fast!

### Multiple entr√©es

Your pages are not limited to one piece of content that you place in the center of

sidebar text that you can insert in different places in the layout.

You're not limited to one blog either: **PieCrust** supports multiple blogs!
