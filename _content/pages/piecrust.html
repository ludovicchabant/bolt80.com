## Quick preview


---detail1---
### Clean kitchen
**PieCrust** stores everything in neatly organized text files in a `_content` directory:

    _content/
        pages/
        posts/
        templates/
        config.yml
    css/
    images/
    otherstuff/

Folders `pages` and `posts` contain what you expect. `templates` contains layouts
and repetitive bits of markup. `config.yml` contains common things like
the site's title, and configuration settings for **PieCrust**.

### Preparation, preparation
Create page templates and reusable bits quickly:

{% raw %}
    <html><head>
        <title>{{page.title}}</title>
    </head><body>
        <h1>{{page.title}}</h1>
        <p>published: {{page.date}}
           by: {{page.author}}</p>
        {{content|raw}}
    </body></html>
{% endraw %}

### Quick appetizer
Create a page or blog post in seconds, with your favorite text editor, using a
very natural syntax:

    ---
    title: My rhubarb pie recipe
    category: desserts
    ---
    You're gonna *love* this one,
    it's so good! You need:
    
    - Pastry crust
    - Rhubarb
    - Sugar

It will be converted into [typographically beautiful text][example] automatically!

  [example]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/example') }}

### Simple at first, complex later
Mundane tasks are easy:

* Create a text file to add a page or post.
* Rename a file to change a page's URL.
* Edit a page's file to change its title, contents, tags or other metadata.
* Edit another file to change layout.

But advanced features give you much power to play with, from layout inheritance
to macros, pagination filtering, conditional includes, multi-blogs and much more.

## Highlights

---detail3---
### Comes with side-orders
**PieCrust** comes with a nice selection of text formatters (**Markdown**, **Textile**,
**SmartyPants**) and template engines (**Twig**, **Mustache**) out-of-the-box.
It supports syntax-highlighting with **GeSHi**, too.

It's super easy to add other things like **Haml**, **Sass** and anything else
you like!

### Super-fast service
Because **PieCrust** is also designed as a lightweight CMS, it can render your pages
in less than a few milliseconds in most cases. It means that previewing or generating
your website is super fast!

---detail4---
### Multiple entr√©es
Your pages are not limited to one piece of content that you place in the center of
your layout. You can define other "_text segments_" like a page-specific menu or
sidebar text that you can insert in different places in the layout.

You're not limited to one blog either -- PieCrust supports multiple blogs!

### On-demand cooking
You don't have to use static generation if you don't need it -- just use **PieCrust**
as a classic PHP CMS that will render requested pages on the fly.
