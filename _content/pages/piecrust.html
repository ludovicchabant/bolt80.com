[PieCrust][] is a very lightweight <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> similar to engines like
[Stacey][]. It's also a static website generator similar to [Jekyll][], [Hyde][] or [AYM-CMS][]. This means you can
use it for both small websites for which you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up the static generation
(although it's very easy to do!), and for bigger websites that need optimal performance.


Features
--------
* Super-simple authoring: it's all just text files!
* Can generate a completely static website that requres with minimum resources for maximum scalability.
* Dynamic stuff can be handled with Javascript and other client-side processing.
* Comments can be handled by 3rd party services like [Disqus][].
* Whole website can be easily stored in a revision control system.

Requirements
------------
[PieCrust][] only requires a web-server running [PHP 5.3+][php] for dynamically rendered websites. If you "[bake]" your
website, however, all you need is a web-server that can serve HTML files! You can't make it simpler (although of course
you'll need some computer with PHP somewhere to do the baking in the first place).
