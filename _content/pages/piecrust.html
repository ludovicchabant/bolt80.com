[PieCrust][] is a very lightweight <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> that's all managed with text files. No complex setup, no databases, no administrative panels. But **PieCrust** is also a static website generator, where you can transform all you content into plain HTML files.


Features
--------
* Super-simple authoring: it's all just text files!
* Your whole website can be easily stored in a revision control system.
* Can generate a completely static website that will run with minimum resources for maximum scalability, or run as a lightweight dynamic CMS.
* Rapid-iteration authoring: even if you use **PieCrust** as a static site generator, you can temporarily switch your website back to dynamic generation for instant preview, or use the built-in development web server that will (re)bake your pages on demand.

### Limitations

* Only static content is supported, but most dynamic content requiring server-side processing is not within **PieCrust**'s scope anyway (user accounts, access permissions, etc.). For this, you should look into a proper CMS engine.
    * For dynamic content like displaying **Flickr** pictures or **Twitter** feeds, you can use client-side scripting (**Javascript** _et al._).
    * For user comments and ratings, you can use 3rd party services like [Disqus][].

### Special features

All those features are pretty standard for static site generators, so what sets **PieCrust** apart?

* _Multiple entr√©es_: your pages are not limited to one piece of content that you place in the center of your layout. You can define other "_text segments_" like a page-specific menu or sidebar text that you can insert in different places in the layout.
* _Comes with side-orders_: **PieCrust** comes with a nice selection of text formatters (**Markdown**, **Textile**, **SmartyPants**) and template engines (**Twig**, **Haml**, **Mustache**, **Dwoo**) out-of-the-box.
* _Super-fast service_: because **PieCrust** is also designed as a lightweight CMS, it can render your pages in less than a few milliseconds in most cases. This means statically generating your whole website will be done way faster than with most other engines.
* _On-demand cooking_: you don't have to use static generation if you don't need it -- just use **PieCrust** as a classic PHP CMS that will render requested pages on the fly (don't worry, that's pretty fast thanks to caching and other tricks).

Requirements
------------
[PieCrust][] only requires a web-server running [PHP 5.3+][php] for dynamically rendered websites. If you "[bake]" your website, however, all you need is a web-server that can serve HTML files (and that's by definition _any_ web server)! You can't make it simpler (although of course you'll need some computer with PHP somewhere to do the baking in the first place).
