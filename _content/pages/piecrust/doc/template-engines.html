**PieCrust** ships with two template engines: [Twig][] and [Mustache][]. Other
template engines are available as plugins, like [Dwoo][] and [Haml][]. See [how
to install a plugin][2].


### Twig

[Twig][] is the default template engine in **PieCrust**, but you can use `twig`
for your template files extensions or page configuration settings if that's not
the case. There's a little crash course for you on the [templates documentation
page][1], along with a presentation of the extensions relevant to your
**PieCrust** website.


### Mustache

[Mustache][] can be used with the `mustache` template file extension or page
configuration setting. It's a very simple template engine with an easy to
remember syntax that doesn't have any of the "programming" constructs of the
other engines on purpose.
