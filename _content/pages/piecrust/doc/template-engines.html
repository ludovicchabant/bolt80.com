**PieCrust** ships with four template engines: [Twig][], [Dwoo][], [Haml][] and [Mustache][].


### Twig

**Twig** is the default template engine in **PieCrust**, but you can use `twig` for your template files extensions or page configuration settings if that's not the case. There's a little crash course for you on the [templates documentation page][1], along with a presentation of the extensions relevant to your **PieCrust** website.


### Mustache

**Mustache** can be used with the `mustache` template file extension or page configuration setting. It's a very simple template engine with an easy to remember syntax that doesn't have any of the "programming" constructs of the other engines on purpose.


### Dwoo

**Dwoo** can be used with the `dwoo` template file extension or page configuration setting. It has a similar set of features to **Twig**, only with a different syntax. It also has the `pcurl`, `pctagurl` and `pccaturl` functions to easily create links to pages.


### Haml

**Haml** can be used with the `haml` template file extension or page configuration setting. However, it's more of a DSL for writing HTML concisely than a proper template engine, so it's mostly useful for layouts with lots of HTML code, few variable placements and little logic (because those 2 last things are done by embedding PHP code in your template, which is not as user-friendly as a proper template engine's syntax).

**PieCrust** uses the [PHamlP][] parser which is the less worse HAML PHP parser around despite [being half-dead](http://code.google.com/p/phamlp/issues/detail?id=85&q=haml) and [with some problems](https://github.com/MarcWeber/phamlp/blob/master/README). However, it's good enough for simple uses. Watch out for the syntax differences with the "official" Ruby implementation.
