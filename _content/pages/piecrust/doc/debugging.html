> **Note**: This section is irrelevant if you bake your website. It's only useful if you use **PieCrust** as a CMS.

While you're building your website, it's a good idea to enable the "*debug*" mode:

* It gets rid of the [caching features][caching], which can prevent your browser from
  showing your the very latest version of a page you just changed a couple seconds ago.
* It shows you the real error messages, complete with file paths and stack traces, instead
  of showing you sugar-coated error messages that don't give any technical details
  most visitors don't care about.
  
Obviously, "*debug*" mode is only valid for dynamically rendered sites (as opposed
to [baked] sites). However, even for baked sites, you could temporarily revert back to
dynamic rendering in "*debug*" mode to iterate faster on your editing without waiting for
the bake to finish... baking is fast, but dynamic rendering is faster!

There are 3 ways to enable "*debug*" mode:

* Append `?!debug` at the end of the URL. For example, go to `http://domain.com/about?!debug`.
* Set the `site/debug` [configuration value][config] to `true`.
* Initialize the `PieCrust` engine with a `array('debug' => true)` parameter.
