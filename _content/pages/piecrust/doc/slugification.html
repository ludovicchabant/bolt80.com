"_Slugification_" is a fancy -- and totally made-up term -- for describing the
process of turning a word into something that can be used in an URL. In the case
of **PieCrust**, it's the process applied to [tags and categories][tags] to
generate URLs to the pages that list all blog posts that have each tag or
category applied.

The problem is that characters valid to be in an URL are pretty limited: they
include any letter from "a" to "z" (upper or lower case), numbers, and a couple
of punctuation characters like "+" or brackets. Any other character needs to be,
somehow, replaced by something else.

You have a choice of 5 "_slugification modes_":

* `transliterate`: **PieCrust** will attempt to replace any non-Latin character
  with a Latin equivalent. This means replacing accentuated characters like "é"
  with their non-accentuated character version, which would be "e" in this case.
  Anything that can't be replaced will be replaced with a dash ("-").

  The end result is that a tag like `décoration` would show up as `decoration`
  in URLs.

  This obviously works for mostly Latin-based languages like French or Spanish,
  but will fail miserably for others like Russian or Japanese.

* `encode`: **PieCrust** will encode any invalid character using percent
  encoding. So for example, `décoration` would show up as `d%C3%A9coration` in
  URLs. Modern web-browsers, however, won't show you the encoded version, and
  instead will transparently show you the decoded version, like everything's
  fine, so it won't be as ugly as you would think.

* `dash`: Just replace invalid characters with a dash. So this time, `décoration`
  will end up as `d-coration`.

* `none`: Don't do anything. You probably don't want that, though.

You can also optionally combine the slugification mode with the `lowercase` flag
so that tags and categories are made lowercase when making up URLs. So a tag
like `iOS` would end up like `ios` in an URL.

Specifying the slugification options is done with the `site/slugify`
[configuration setting][config]. So for example, to use `encode` and
`lowercase`:

    site:
        slugify: encode,lowercase
