title: Site configuration
---

Your website can be configured with the `_content/config.yml` file. You write it
using the [YAML][] syntax, like this:

    site:
        title: My new fancy website
        author: John Doe
        pretty_urls: true    
    
The "*site*" section is by convention for, well, the site's settings. Some of
them are used by **PieCrust** during processing. Other sections would be for
plugins like formatters or template engines. You can even specify settings in
custom sections of your own, since the whole configuration will be [exposed to
your pages and templates][5].

    site:
        title: My new fancy website
        author: John Doe

    something:
        key: value
        key2:
            - this is
            - how you
            - specify arrays


### Reference

Here's a reference of the site configuration settings used by **PieCrust**. They
must be all in the `site` section.

* `root`: The root URL of the website. It defaults to `/`, which should be
  what you want in most cases. It will be prepended to page slugs by
  **PieCrust** in several places, like with the [URL functions][7].

* `pretty_urls`: Enables URL rewriting for [prettier looking page addresses][1].

* `posts_per_page`: The number of posts to return for displaying on a single
  page. See the [pagination documentation][2]. The default value is 5 posts.

* `posts_fs`: The file system organization for the blog posts. Should be `flat`,
  `shallow` or `hierarchy`, although other types exist. See [how to create a blog post][3].

* `post_url`: The URL pattern for blog post addresses. The default pattern is
  `%year%/%month%/%day%/%slug%`. You don't have to use all of the pattern
  captures (`%year%`, `%month%`, `%day%` and `%slug%`), but you _have_ to at
  least use `%slug%`.

* `tag_url`: The URL pattern for the pages listing blog posts tagged with a
  given tag. The default pattern is `tag/%tag%`.

* `category_url`: The URL pattern for the pages listing blog posts belonging to
  a given category. The default pattern is `%category%`.

* `date_format`: The date format to use for exposing formatted blog post dates
  to the template engine. The default format is `F j, Y`.

* `enable_gzip`: Enables *gzip* compression of rendered pages if the client
  browser supports it.

* `cache_time`: Specifies the client cache time to specify in the HTTP headers.
  See [caching][4] for more information. The default value is 28800 (8 hours).

* `default_format`: Specifies the default text formatter to use. **Markdown** is
  the default formatter.

* `default_template_engine`: Specifies what template engine to use. **Twig** is
  the default engine.

* `templates_dirs`: Specifies additional template directories besides
  `_content/templates`. Can either be a single path, or an array of paths. You
  can specify paths relative to the site's root path.

* `plugins_dirs`: Specifies additional plugins directories besides
  `_content/plugins`. Can either be a single path, or an array of paths. You can
  specify paths relative to the site's root path.

* `enable_debug_info`: If you're using **PieCrust** in dynamic CMS mode, visitors could use the [debugging features][6] to expose potentially private information. You can disable those features on the production server to prevent that.

* `auto_formats`: Specifies a list that maps an extension to a format name. This makes it possible to use different file extensions for pages and posts, like `.md` for Markdown content or `.textile` for Textile content. For example:

        site:
          auto_formats:
            md: markdown
            textile: textile
