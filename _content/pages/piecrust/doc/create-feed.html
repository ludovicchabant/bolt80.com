title: Create an RSS/Atom feed
layout: piecrust_doc

Creating an RSS or Atom feed is basically similar to creating your blog's home
page, only the markup is RSS or Atom instead of HTML (you can look up the [RSS]
or [Atom] formats on **Wikipedia** for more information). The only difference
is that you probably don't want any [sub-pages][3] created for the feed,
especially when [baking the site][1].


You can achieve this with either one of the following solutions.

#### Adjusting the pagination

Set the `single_page` setting to `true`, and change the number of posts shown
in the feed. Your feed page header would look like this:

    ---
    posts_per_page: 10
    single_page: true
    ---
    <feed>...</feed>

#### Using the blog archives

Instead of using `pagination.posts` to show the list of posts, you can use
`blog.posts`. This would, however, show you _all_ the posts in your blog,
instead of the few last ones, so you would have to limit it like so
`blog.posts.limit(10)`.

This is the preferred way, since it is much shorter.


### Other considerations

Note how it's also a good idea to specify the `content_type` so **PieCrust**
sets the correct HTTP headers when dynamically rendering the page, or uses the
correct file extension when baking. Setting it to `xml` or `rss` would work
fine.
