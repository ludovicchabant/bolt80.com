title: Create an RSS/Atom feed
layout: piecrust_doc

Creating an RSS or Atom feed is basically similar to creating your blog's home page, only the markup is RSS or Atom instead of HTML (you can look up the [RSS] or [Atom] formats on **Wikipedia** for more information). The only difference is that you probably don't want any [sub-pages][3] created for the feed, especially when [baking the site][1].

All you have to do is set the `single_page` setting to `true`. You also probably want to change the number of posts shown in the feed, so your feed page header would look like this:

    ---
    content_type: rss
    posts_per_page: 10
    single_page: true
    ---
    <feed>...</feed>

Note how it's a good idea to specify the `content_type` so **PieCrust** sets the correct HTTP headers when dynamically rendering the page, or uses the correct file extension when baking.
