title: Create an RSS/Atom feed

Creating an RSS or Atom feed is basically similar to creating your blog's home
page, only the markup is RSS or Atom instead of HTML (you can look up the [RSS]
or [Atom] formats on **Wikipedia** for more information). The only difference
is that you probably don't want any [sub-pages][3] created for the feed,
especially when [baking the site][1].

You can achieve this with either one of the following solutions.


### Blog feed using pagination

Set the `single_page` setting to `true` (to prevent the creation of sub-pages),
and change the number of posts shown in the feed with `posts_per_page`. Your
feed page would look like this:

    ---
    posts_per_page: 10
    single_page: true
    ---
    <feed>
    ...
    {% raw %}{% for post in pagination.posts %}
    {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
    ...
    </feed>

### Blog feed using blog archives

Instead of using `pagination.posts` to show the list of posts, you can use
the [blog archives][4] like such:

    <feed>
    ...
    {% raw %}{% for post in blog.posts.limit(10) %}
    {% endfor %}{% endraw %}
    ...
    </feed>

This is the preferred way, since it is much shorter.

Note the use of `.limit(10)` to specify how many maximum posts should be
included in the feed.
