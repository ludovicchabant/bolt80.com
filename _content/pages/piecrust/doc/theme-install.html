You can install a theme with the `chef themes` command:

1. First you need to find a theme. You can use the `chef themes find` command for that, and it will list the available themes given your `site/themes_sources` setting.

2. Once you know the name of the theme, you can install it with `chef themes install <themename>`.


### Theme sources

The `site/themes_sources` lists the souces from which you can get themes. **PieCrust** supports only 2 types of sources at the moment:

* *File-system*: a file-system source is defined simply with a path, relative to the root or the website (unless the path itself is an absolute path). Such a theme source should have available themes under sub-directories -- each sub-directory being a theme.

* *Bitbucket*: a Bitbucket source is an URL to a BitBucket account, _i.e._ of the form: `http://bitbucket.org/<username>`. It will look for repositories whose name starts with `PieCrust-Theme-` and return those as themes available for install.


### Install themes manually

Installing a **PieCrust** theme manually is pretty simple: create the `_content/theme` directory and copy all the theme's files into it. That's it! The `chef themes install` command will do that for you so you probably never will have to do it, but you may occasionally want to create a symbolic link or junction path between a theme you're working on and the `_content/theme` of a website you want to test it in.
