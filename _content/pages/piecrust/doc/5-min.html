            Download the [latest version of PieCrust][1] and extract it somewhere nice.
            [1]: https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/piecrust/get/stable.zip
            
            <pre><code>wget https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/piecrust/get/stable.zip -O piecrust.zip
            unzip piecrust.zip</code></pre>
            
    %li
        :markdown
            Run the **PieCrust** development server to check it out.
            
            <pre><code>cd ludovicchabant-piecrust_sample-tip
            _piecrust/chef serve website</code></pre>
    %li
        :markdown
            Now look into `website/_content/config.yml` (that's the [configuration file][1])
            and change what obviously needs to be changed.
            [1]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/site-config') }}
    %li
        :markdown
            Add/edit some [pages][1] and [layouts][2]. Refresh the web browser, and see you changes right away!
            [1]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/create-page') }}
            [2]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/layout') }}
    %li
        :markdown
            When you're ready, bake your website:
            
            <pre><code>_piecrust/chef bake website</code></pre>
            
            Your [statically generated website][1] is waiting for you on the counter, in `website/_counter`!
