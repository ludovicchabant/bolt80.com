            Point your favorite PHP-enabled web server to the `website` directory, and
            change the permissions on `website/_cache` to make it writable for the web server.
            Launch it in your favorite web browser!

        :markdown
            Now look into `website/_content/config.yml` (that's the [configuration file][1])
            and change what obviously needs to be changed.
