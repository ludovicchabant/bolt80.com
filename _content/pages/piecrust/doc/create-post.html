Creating a blog post is a lot like [creating a page][1], only you create the text file in the `posts` folder instead of `pages`.

### Naming conventions

There are 2 ways of organizing the `posts` folder: *flat* or *hierarchical*. By default **PieCrust** uses the "*flat*" mode. You can change the mode in the [site configuration][2]


#### Flat organization

In "*flat*" mode, all blog posts are HTML files that follow this naming convention:

    <year>-<month>-<day>_<slug>.html

Here's an example:

    2010-08-23_why-i-love-bacon.html

By default, that article would be accessible at `http://domain.com/2010/08/23/why-i-love-bacon`, although you can also change the URL format of blog posts in the [site configuration][2] (e.g. you want to add "blog" in front).


#### Hierarchical organization

In "*hierarchical*" mode, the year and month of a blog post are specified by the sub-folders in which they reside:

    posts
     |- 2009
     |- 2010
         |- 07
         |- 08
             |- 23_why-i-love-bacon.html
         |- 09

The article would be reached at the same address as before, but you may like this folder organization better, especially if you have lots of posts.


### Page breaks

When a page displays a list of blog posts, you sometimes don't want to put the complete posts texts in there -- instead, you only want the introduction of the post to be used. You can "cut" a post in two by inserting one of the "page break" tags:

    <!-- more -->
    <!-- break -->
    <!-- pagebreak -->

Any of these tags would tell the pagination system to only take whatever comes before that tag when a post is shown in a list. See the [pagination documentation][5] for more info.


### Configuration values

In addition to the [usual page configuration values][3], blog posts can define a few useful things:

* `time`: Use this to specify a time of day for when the post was written (e.g. "12:45:02"). **PieCrust** will use it to expose the correct `date` and `timestamp` variables to the template engine.

* `tags`: Use this to add tags to a post, so that it appears in [tag listings][4]. This should be an array, like so: `tags: [ food, cooking, fun ]`.

* `category`: Use this to put this post into one category, so that it appears in [category listings][4].

Other useful variables to define are `author` or `summary`, although **PieCrust** wouldn't do anything special with those -- it's just that they would be commonly used by pages showing those posts.
