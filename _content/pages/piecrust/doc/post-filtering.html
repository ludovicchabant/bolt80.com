Any time a function returns a [post iterator][1], you can apply some filtering to the list of posts you will get from it. This is done with the `filter(filtername)` function, which takes the name of the filter to apply. A filter is a section in the [page configuration][2] that follows the post filtering syntax.


### Basic syntax

The basic filtering syntax lets you filter using the page's configuration settings:

* `has_something`: this will look for the `something` setting in the post's
configuration header. If that setting is an array, and it contains the specified
value, then the post is included in the page. Otherwise, it's skipped.

* `is_something`: this will look for the `something` setting in the post's
configuration header. If that setting exists and is the same as the specified
value, then the post is included in the page. Otherwise, it's skipped.

So for example, the following filter would return all the posts with the tag "_recipe_":

    ---
    recipes:
        has_tags: recipe
    ---
    {% raw %}
    {% for post in blog.posts.filter('recipes') %}
    ...
    {% endfor %}
    {% endraw %}


### Boolean operators

You can also group `has_*` and `is_*` statements in `and` and `or` sections to
create more complex queries:

    my_filter:
        has_tags: announcement
        or:
            has_tags: piecrust
            has_tags: stupidhttp

This would return only posts with announcements regarding PieCrust or
StupidHttp.

You can also use the `not` clause to exclude something:

    my_filter:
        has_tags: announcement
        not:
            has_tags: family

This will return all announcement posts except those regarding family stuff.

#### Default operator

Note that the default top level group is nested inside an `and` operator, so the following will list only posts with both the `piecrust` and `announcement` tags applied:

    my_filter:
        has_tags: piecrust
        has_tags: announcement


### The pagination object

Note that the `pagination` object, used for getting a [paginated list of posts][3], will by default load a filter named `posts_filters`. However, it also returns a post iterator with `pagination.posts`, so you could also apply a filter at the end like this:

    pagination.posts.filter('my_filter')

**Don't do this**. It most probably won't do what you want.
    
The difference is that the `posts_filters` will be taken into account for the pagination, and the `filter()` is only applied after that:
    
* If you filter all posts with the tag `recipe` using `posts_filters`, and there are 7 of them, you will get 2 pages out of `pagination` (assuming 5 posts per page).

* If however you use the `filter()` function to only return `recipe` posts, you will end up with *each page* being filtered. So if, out of the *5 latest posts* of your blog, only 1 is a recipe, you will only get one post on the first page. If, in the next 5 posts, none is a recipe, your page 2 will be empty. And so on.

In conclusion: don't use the `filter()` method on the `pagination` object.
