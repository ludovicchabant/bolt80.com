The post iterator object is returned by several [template variables][4] in **PieCrust**, including `pagination.posts` and `blog.posts`. It basically represents a list of posts or pages, so that you can loop over it (_e.g._ with the `for` construct in **Twig**), but also has a few interesting things of its own.


### Properties

* `count`: Returns the number of posts in the array (after all filters,
  offsets and limits have been applied).

* `all`: Resets the filtering currently active for the page and returns
  _all_ posts. In most cases, it's a better idea to use `blog.posts` instead.
  See the [blog archives][3] documentation.


### Functions

* `skip(n)`: Skips _n_ posts from the beginning of the array.

* `limit(n)`: Limits the number of posts in the array to _n_.

* `filter(filtername)`: Applies a filter named `filtername` to the
  pagination. This must be a page configuration setting similar to
  `post_filters`, but named `filtername`.

* `in_category(name)`: Returns only posts in category `name`.

* `with_tag(name)`: Returns only posts with tag `name`.

* `with_tags(name1, name2, ...)`: Returns only posts with all given tag
  names.

All those methods return the iterator itself, so you can chain them. For
instance, the following code snippet would return the first 10 posts in category
'recipes'.

    blog.posts.in_category('recipes').limit(10)

Note that these functions are not cumulative, so `posts.skip(3).skip(1)` will
_not_ skip 4 posts from the beginning of the array -- it will only skip 1 post!
(the last specified skip value). Similarly, `in_category`, `with_tag` and
`with_tags` are not cumulative either:
`posts.in_category('recipes').with_tag('apple')` will return all posts tagged
with "_apple_" regardless of their category. Those methods are only for
convenience -- if you want complex filtering, use the `filter()` method instead.


### Post object reference

Now here's a list of variables available on each post:

* `url`: That's the local address of the post. You need to prepend the
`site.root` to it, or pass it through the `pcurl` function if you want to use it
as a hyperlink.

* `slug`: The relative URL of the post.

* `date`: The formatted date of the post. The date format is the one defined in
the [page][1]'s or [site][2]'s configuration.

* `timestamp`: The timestamp of the post, in case you need to re-format the date
yourself.

* `content`: The contents of the post.

* `has_more`: If the post had a page break in it, the `content` variable only
returns the first part (the "*excerpt*"), and `has_more` is set to `true` so you
can add a "*Read more...*" link that points to the post's URL.

Also, the whole page configuration of the post is available directly, along
with the other content segments. This means that `post.extra_stuff` refers
either to a content segment called `extra_stuff`, or a configuration setting of
the same name.
