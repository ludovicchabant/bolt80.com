title: Content segments
layout: piecrust_doc

In **PieCrust**, [pages][] define the _content_ of your website when [templates][] define (among other things) the _layout_ of your website. As you'll see in the [templates documentation][templates], the "placeholder" for the text of a page is called `content`. We also previously mentioned how the [page configuration][pageconfig] exposes anything defined in it, so you could in theory define other pieces of content in the configuration, like for instance a page-specific menu or sidebar text. This is not really practical, however, because the **YAML** syntax used for the page configuration is mostly designed for small things like configuration settings and one-liners.

Thankfully, **PieCrust** lets you define other "_text segments_" in addition to the default "_content_" segment. You do this by writing a line formatted like so:

    ---nameofsegment---
    
Anything between this line and either the end of the file or the next text segment defines the contents of that text segment.

For example, the following page has 2 segments: `content` and `sidebar`:

    ---
    title: Some page with 2 text segments
    layout: awesome_layout
    ---
    This is the main text. It's formatted with **Markdown**
    as usual (or whatever default formatter you use).
    
    That's pretty much it.
    
    ---sidebar---
    Now this is a text in the "sidebar" segment. It's also
    formatted, but can be inserted in a completely different
    place in the layout.

The same way you insert the main text in your layout using the `content` variable (_e.g._ {% raw %}`{{ content|raw }}`{% endraw %} if you're using the default **Twig** template engine), you can insert any other text segment in your layout by using the variable named after the segment (_e.g._ {% raw %}`{{ sidebar|raw }}`{% endraw %}). For more information on template variables and layouts, see the [templating documentation][templates].


### The default segment

The default segment (`content`) is always the first one, found
right after the [page configuration header][pageconfig]. If for
some reason you don't want a default segment, just start a named
segment immediately after the header like so:

    ---
    title: Some weird page
    ---
    ---nameofsegment---
    Text goes here...
