layout: piecrust_doc

In **PieCrust**, pages usually define the _content_ of your website. You need to
also define what _layout_ it will fit into, so you can re-use that layout with
multiple pages.

You can specify the layout to use for a page by using the `layout` setting in
the configuration header:

    ---
    title: My awesome page
    layout: some-cool-layout
    ---
    ...page contents go here...

This will tell **PieCrust** to go find a template file in
`_content/templates/some-cool-layout.html`. By default, a page's layout is,
unsurprisingly, `default`, which means it will use the template found in
`_content/templates/default.html`.

Now's a good time to [read about templates][1].


### Specifying the layout extension

As mentioned above, if you set the `layout` to `foo`, **PieCrust** will look for
a `foo.html` template file. If, however, you set `layout` to `foo.haml`,
**PieCrust** will look for a `foo.haml` template file -- _i.e._ it only looks
for an HTML file if you don't already specify an extension.

Extensions are used for specifying what [template engine][2] to use.


### Not using any layout

Template files are useful for reusing the same markup across several pages, but
you may have a page that is just unique. Writing a specific layout file just for
that one page is unproductive, so you could just make the page self-contained by
not using any layout at all. To achieve this, set the `layout` to `none`.
