"*Baking*" is the **PieCrust** name for transforming your website into a bunch of static HTML files.


### Why and when to bake

There are quite a few advantages for doing so:

* You get the fatest website possible.
* You barely use any of your web-server's resources.
* There are no security holes in your website.

When to bake:

* You have a very high traffic website, or expect/hope to have high traffic in the near future.
* You have a blog section with many articles, or with lots of categories and/or tags (this is where **PieCrust** doesn't scale well compared to SQL-enabled CMS engines).
* You don't have PHP 5.3+ on your web server.
* You just don't want to worry!


### Running the baker

You run the baker through [_chef_][chef] with the `bake` command. Type `chef bake --help` for a detailed usage.

In the most simple case, baking your website is done like this:

    chef bake /path/to/root/directory

This would bake the given root directory (the directory that contains `_content`) into a sub-directory named `_counter`.

If you want to bake into a specific output directory, type:

    chef bake -o /path/to/output  /path/to/root/directory
    
For example, with the [recommended **PieCrust** directory structure][struct], you would set the output folder to the `mywebsite.com` folder.

On top of baking all the **PieCrust** content (pages, posts, tags, categories, etc.), _chef_ also bakes any other file found in the root directory. See the section on [file processors][procs] for more information.


### Customizing the baking

#### Specifying files to skip

By default, `chef` ignores any file that starts with an underscore (`_`), which includes the cache and content directories. It also ignores common system and revision control files: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `.git`, `.hg` and `.svn`.

But you can tell it to skip some specific files if you don't want them to be processed or copied to the output directory. You do this through the `baker/skip_patterns` [configuration setting][config]. For example:

    baker:
        skip_patterns:
            - /^_/
            - index.php
            - .htaccess
            - web.config

Any pattern that begins and ends with a `/` will be treated as a regular expression. All other patterns are treated like classic UNIX [_glob_ patterns][1]. The default patterns that exclude the system and revision control files mentioned previously are also automatically appended to those you specify.


#### Specifying tag combinations

By default, `chef` will bake any tag combinations you use in your site by using the `[pctagurl][templates]` function. But if you want a tag combination to be available for linking from outside of your site, you can specify it in the `baker/tag_combinations` [configuration setting][config]. For example:

    baker:
        tag_combinations:
            - kids/photos
            - some-tag/some-other-tag
            - tag1/tag2/tag3

You can specify tags in whatever order you want, but only that order would be baked (`kids/photos` is a different URL than `photos/kids`, even if the contents are likely to be identical).
