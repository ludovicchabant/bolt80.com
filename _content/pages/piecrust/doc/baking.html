"*Baking*" is the **PieCrust** name for transforming your website into a bunch of static HTML files.


### Why and when to bake

There are quite a few advantages for doing so:

* You get the fatest website possible.
* You barely use any of your web-server's resources.
* There are no security holes in your website.

When to bake:

* You have a very high traffic website, or expect/hope to have high traffic in the near future.
* You have a blog section with many articles, or with lots of categories and/or tags (this is where **PieCrust** doesn't scale well compared to SQL-enabled CMS engines).
* You don't have PHP 5.3+ on your web server.
* You just don't want to worry!


### Running the baker

You run the baker through [_chef_][chef] with the `bake` command. Type `chef bake --help` for a detailed usage.

In the most simple case, baking your website is done like this:

    chef bake /path/to/root/directory

This would bake the given root directory (the directory that contains `_content`) into a sub-directory named `_counter`.

If you want to bake into a specific output directory, type:

    chef bake -o /path/to/output  /path/to/root/directory
    
For example, with the [recommended **PieCrust** directory structure][struct], you would set the output folder to the `mywebsite.com` folder.

On top of baking all the **PieCrust** content (pages, posts, tags, categories, etc.), _chef_ also bakes any other file found in the root directory. See the section on [file processors][procs] for more information.
