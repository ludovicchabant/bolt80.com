"*Baking*" is the **PieCrust** name for transforming your website into a bunch
of static HTML files.


### Why and when to bake

There are quite a few advantages for doing so:

* You get the fatest website possible.
* You barely use any of your web-server's resources.
* There are no security holes in your website.

When to bake:

* You have a very high traffic website, or expect/hope to have high traffic in
  the near future.
* You have a blog section with many articles, or with lots of categories and/or
  tags (this is where **PieCrust** doesn't scale well compared to SQL-enabled
  CMS engines).
* You don't have PHP 5.3+ on your web server.
* You just don't want to worry!


### Running the baker

You run the baker through [_chef_][chef] with the `bake` command. Type `chef
bake --help` for a detailed usage.

In the most simple case, baking your website is done like this (if you're
already in your website's root directory):

    chef bake

This would bake the website found at the current directory (it should contain
`_content`) into a sub-directory named `_counter`.

If you want to bake into a specific output directory, from a specific root
directory, type:

    chef --root=/path/to/root bake -o /path/to/output
    
For example, with the [recommended **PieCrust** directory structure][struct],
you would set the output folder to the `mywebsite.com` folder.

On top of baking all the **PieCrust** content (pages, posts, tags, categories,
etc.), _chef_ also bakes any other file found in the root directory. In most
cases it means just copying stuff over (images, CSS stylesheets, etc.), but
sometimes it also means processing the file along the way. See the section on
[file processors][procs] for more information.


### Customizing the baking

#### Configuration variants

You can use a slightly different configuration while baking by using
[configuration variants][vars]. By default, baking will apply the `baker`
variant unless it doesn't exist, or another one is specified.


#### Specifying tag combinations

By default, _chef_ will bake any tag combinations that you used in your site
through a `pctagurl` [template function][templates]. But if you want a tag
combination to be available for linking from outside of your site, or if you
didn't use the `pctagurl` function, you can specify tag combinations to bake in
the `baker/tag_combinations` [configuration setting][config]. For example:

    baker:
        tag_combinations:
            - kids/photos
            - some-tag/some-other-tag
            - tag1/tag2/tag3

You can specify tags in whatever order you want, but only that order would be
baked (`kids/photos` is a different URL than `photos/kids`, even if the contents
are likely to be identical).


#### Making a website portable

You may want to bake a website in a way that you can just double-click on the
index page using the Windows Explorer or MacOS Finder, and browse from there
directly from the file-system.

You can do that using the `--portable` option of the `chef bake` command, or by
setting the `baker/portable_urls` configuration setting to `true`.

This is especially useful if you need to copy the website to a USB key to show
someone on their own machine, which may not have any web-server available.
