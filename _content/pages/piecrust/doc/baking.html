"*Baking*" is the **PieCrust** name for transforming your website into a bunch
of static HTML files.


### Why and when to bake

There are quite a few advantages for doing so:

* You get the fatest website possible.
* You barely use any of your web-server's resources.
* There are no security holes in your website.

When to bake:

* You have a very high traffic website, or expect/hope to have high traffic in
  the near future.
* You have a blog section with many articles, or with lots of categories and/or
  tags (this is where **PieCrust** doesn't scale well compared to SQL-enabled
  CMS engines).
* You don't have PHP 5.3+ on your web server.
* You just don't want to worry!


### Running the baker

You run the baker through [_chef_][chef] with the `bake` command. Type `chef
bake --help` for a detailed usage.

In the most simple case, baking your website is done like this (if you're
already in your website's root directory):

    chef bake

This would bake the website found at the current directory (it should contain
`_content`) into a sub-directory named `_counter`.

If you want to bake into a specific output directory, from a specific root
directory, type:

    chef bake -o /path/to/output  --root /path/to/root
    
For example, with the [recommended **PieCrust** directory structure][struct],
you would set the output folder to the `mywebsite.com` folder.

On top of baking all the **PieCrust** content (pages, posts, tags, categories,
etc.), _chef_ also bakes any other file found in the root directory. In most
cases it means just copying stuff over (images, CSS stylesheets, etc.), but
sometimes it also means processing the file along the way. See the section on
[file processors][procs] for more information.


### Customizing the baking

#### Specifying tag combinations

By default, _chef_ will bake any tag combinations that you used in your site
through a `pctagurl` [template function][templates]. But if you want a tag
combination to be available for linking from outside of your site, or if you
didn't use the `pctagurl` function, you can specify tag combinations to bake in
the `baker/tag_combinations` [configuration setting][config]. For example:

    baker:
        tag_combinations:
            - kids/photos
            - some-tag/some-other-tag
            - tag1/tag2/tag3

You can specify tags in whatever order you want, but only that order would be
baked (`kids/photos` is a different URL than `photos/kids`, even if the contents
are likely to be identical).


#### Specifying configuration variants

Sometimes you want to bake a website with slightly different configuration
settings than when you preview it.

A common case is the `site/root` setting, which defines the base URL for a
website. When previewed, you generally want **PieCrust** to figure out what that
base URL is (something like `http://localhost:8080/mywebsite/`). However, when
you bake it, you want a specific base URL like `http://mydomain.com`. Well, you
can do this with the `baker/config_variants` setting:

    baker:
        config_variants:
            default:
                site:
                    root: http://mydomain.com

The `default` configuration variant is the one _chef_ will use by default when
baking. You can specify another configuration variant _via_ command line options
if you need multiple variants:

    chef bake -c other_variant
