Baking your website
-------------------

"*Baking*" is the **PieCrust** name for transforming your website into a bunch of static
HTML files.

### Why and when to bake

There are quite a few advantages for doing so:

* You get the fatest website possible.
* You barely use any of your web-server's resources (except disk space).
* It's easy backup/deploy your whole website.

There are obviously disadvantages, too:

* It takes up more disk space (but not that much, and disk space is one of the cheapest resources these days anyway).
* It makes it impossible to do server-side dynamic content (but in most of the situations we're interested in, dynamic
content can be handled on the client by Javascript _et al_... if not, like user management, then you probably need a
full-blown CMS or Wiki engine anyway).

If you have a "blog" or "news" section on your website and you post new articles
often, you probably want to bake your site. If you have high traffic, or expect to
in the near future, you also shoud bake your site.



### Running the baker

The baker is located in the `_chef` directory of your website. On **Windows**, you can run it with the `bake.cmd`
command-line script. On **Mac OS X** or **Linux** you can run the `bake.php` script directly, or through the `php`
command (like so: `php bake.php`) if PHP was not installed in `/usr/bin`.

In the most simple case, baking your website is done by running the following command:

    bake -r SITE_ROOT_DIR -o OUTPUT_DIR -h HOST_NAME

Where:

* *SITE_ROOT_DIR* is your site's root directory (the one containing `_content` and `_cache`).
* *OUTPUT_DIR* is the directory where all the static HTML files will be generated. That's the directory you would
  expose to the internet.
* *HOST_NAME* is your site's root URL.

To get a list of all the other options, type:

    bake --help
