Creating a new page is as easy as creating a new text file... probably because that's all there is to it.

The directory and name of that text file will decide what URL this page is accessible from. For example, creating the file `_content/pages/food/bacon.html` would make the page:

* `http://domain.com/food/bacon` (with "[pretty URLs][1]")
* `http://domain.com/?/food/bacon` (without, dynamic website)
* `http://domain.com/food/bacon.html` (without, baked website)

To create the main page for your website (the one used for `http://domain.com`), use `_content/pages/_index.html`.

The text file's extension must be "html", even if that page happens to not be HTML, sorry (but see the [page configuration][3] documentation on `content_type`).

For more information on your website's directory structure, check out the [documentation on the subject][2].

> **WARNING**: Don't create pages whose names are just a number (like `4.html`). This could mess up the [pagination features][6].


### Writing contents

The contents of the page are, by default, [Markdown][] text (to change this, see [page][3] and [site][4] configurations). This means that text like this:

    This is some sample text. It has stuff like
    *paragraphs* and *emphasized words* and all 
    that jazz. It's seriously pretty cool, 
    especially since it's so **natural** to write.
    
    So Basically:
    
    * It's easy
    * It's useful
    * It creates nice typography

See the [Markdown documentation][markdowndoc] for more info on the syntax.


### Template syntax appetizer

The template system exposes several variables that you can use when writing pages. We go into this in more detail in the [templates documentation][5] but here are a few tips to get you started.

With the default template engine, [Twig][], variables are referenced using double-curly-brackets:

{% raw %}
    {{ variable }}
{% endraw %}

A very helpful variable would be `site.root`, which is the root URL of your website. That's pretty handy for hyperlinks. For example, if you want to link to the `about/contact` page, you could write:

{% raw %}
    [Contact me!]({{ site.root }}about/contact)
{% endraw %}

That was the **Markdown** syntax for a hyperlink, by the way.

Another more advanced tip is to make this work whether you have [pretty URLs][1] turned on or not (the previous example would only work with pretty URLs _enabled_). **Twig** also supports functions, and you can call a function on a variable. The `pcurl` creates a **PieCrust** URL with the correct syntax according to whether you have pretty URLs enabled or not. So you could rewrite your contact link like so:

{% raw %}
    [Contact me!]({{ pcurl('about/contact') }})
{% endraw %}

For more information, check out the [templates documentation][5], and **Twig**'s [own documentation][twigdoc].
