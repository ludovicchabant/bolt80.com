Creating a new page is as easy as creating a new text file... probably because that's all there is to it.

The directory and name of that text file will decide what path this page is accessible from. Assuming you've got the '[pretty URLs][1]' option turned on, creating the file `_content/food/bacon.html` would make the page reachable at `http://domain.com/food/bacon`.

The contents of the page are, by default, [Markdown][] text.
