In **PieCrust**, there are two ways to show a list of blog posts, or somehow
manipulate the blog posts in bulk. The first is to use the [pagination
features][1], exposed through the `pagination` [template variable][2]. This
will however, somewhat unsurprisingly, trigger pagination on the current page
(_i.e._ create sub-pages of the current page that can be accessed with "_next
entries_"/"_previous entries_"-type of links). That can be stopped with the
`single_page` [configuration setting][3], but the list of posts will still be,
by default, limited and filtered according to the default pagination settings.

The other way is to use the more straightforward blog archives.

Blog archive variables are accessed through the `blog` template variable,
unless you have [more than one blog defined][4]. In that case, there will be
one blog archive per blog, each named after each blog. This means that if your
blogs are defined as `artblog` and `cookingblog`, those will be the names of
the template variables through which you access the archives. In the rest of
this page we will be referring to the main case of a `blog` variable, however.


### List of posts

You can get an unlimited and unfiltered list of blog posts with `blog.posts`.

This list has the same available properties and functions than the list of
posts returned by `pagination.posts` (see the [pagination documentation][1]).
This includes functions like `count`, `skip(n)`, `limit(n)` and
`filter(filtername)`.

> Again, the difference between this and tweaking the `pagination.posts` list
> to your liking is that the pagination one will create sub-pages -- using
> `blog.posts` will not.

You can also access the list of tags and categories with `blog.tags` and `blog.categories`. Each entry in those arrays will be rendered as the name of the tag or category, but they also have a few properties of their own:

* `name`: the name of the tag or category (for convenience/readability).

* `posts`: the list of posts in that tag or category.

Each post returned by `blog.posts` or either a tag or category has the same properties than a post returned by `pagination.posts`. This includes properties like `url`, `date`, `content`, or `has_more`. 


### Yearly and monthly archives

To make writing blog archives easier, the `blog` variable also exposes posts split by year or month. They are available in `blog.years` and `blog.months`. Each entry in those arrays will be rendered as the name of the year or month (_e.g._ `2011` or `2012 01`), but they also have a few properties of their own:

* `name`: the name of the year or month (for convenience/readability).

* `timestamp`: the timestamp of the year or month, so you can pass it through a custom date format.

* `posts`: the posts in that year or month.

Again, the posts returned by a year or month property have the same properties than a post returned by `pagination.posts`.
