The **PieCrust** _chef_ is a command-line utility that let you do cool things
with your website. It takes the name of a _command_ and a bunch of other
arguments. It's located in the `_piecrust` directory, but it's a good idea to
add it to your `PATH` environment variable so you can run it from anywhere.

> #### A note on your environment
> 
> Typing `chef` will actually run the little batch bootstrap that tries to find
> PHP on your system. Otherwise, you'd have to type `my/path/to/phpexe chef.php`.
> If it can't find PHP, it will tell you.
> 
> The bootstrap is known to work on both Windows and MacOS.


### Commands

There's a lot of useful commands available in _chef_. Type `chef help` to get a
list of them. There's also a list of additional help topics that will give you
more information.


### Contextual behaviour

The **PieCrust** _chef_ behaves differently depending on the current directory:
it knows if you're currently in a **PieCrust** website or not (by trying to find
the `_content/config.yml` file somewhere up in the folder hierarchy). This is
similar to how Mercurial or Git work.

When you're outside of a website, one of the few commands that work are `help`,
of course, and `init`, which creates a new empty website.

When inside a website, most commands work, and the main ones are probably `bake`
(for [baking][] your website) and `serve` (to [preview][] your website). For a
complete list of available commands, run `chef help`. Also, any commands defined
by a plugin loaded by the current website will be available.

If you don't want to change your current working directory, for some reason, you
can specify the actual root website directory you want _chef_ to use with the
`--root` command-line option.
