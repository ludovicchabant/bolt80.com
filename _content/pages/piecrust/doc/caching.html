title: Caching features
---

**PieCrust** uses caching internally to deliver your website in less than a few milliseconds in most cases,
but it's also trying to play nice with the caching features found in proxy servers and modern web browsers.

Unless [debugging][] is enabled, **PieCrust** will check the [ETag header][etag] provided by the client
browser and send a `304` status code if the content hasn't changed. If the content has changed, or if it's
the first time the client requests that page, **PieCrust** will also specify a cache time for that page.

The page cache time is 8 hours by default, or whatever value was specified either in the page or site
[configuration][config]. This value must be specified in seconds, or must be `false` if you want to disable
this behaviour. On the page, the configuration value is `cache_time`. In the site's `config.yml`, it is
`site/cache_time`. As usual, the page's configuration takes precedence over the site's.
