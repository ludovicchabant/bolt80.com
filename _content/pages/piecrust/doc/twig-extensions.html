**PieCrust** adds a few functions to **Twig** by default. They greatly help with
authoring a website.


### URL functions

You can easily insert the URL to a page without having to think about whether
you have [pretty URLs][1] enabled or not, or if it's for a baked website or not,
or if you have [debugging][4] enabled or not. That's done with the `pcurl` function:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('my/page') }}
{% endraw %}

Similarly to the `pcurl` function, the `pctagurl` and `pccaturl` functions will
generate URLs to a [tag or category listing page][2] with respect to the site
configuration:

{% raw %}
    {{ pctagurl('sometag') }}
    {{ pccaturl('category') }}
{% endraw %}

Last but not least, the `pcposturl` function generates the URL to a post given a
year, month, day and name. It will take into account the [posts file-system][3]
when generating the URL:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcposturl(2011, 11, 21, 'some-post') }}
{% endraw %}

Those functions will update their output automatically if you change the posts,
tags or categories URL formats.


### Word count function

The `wordcount(text)` function counts the number of words in the given text.


### Nocache filter

This filter adds an URL query parameter of the form `?t=12345` at the end of the
provided text. This is useful to prevent caching on updated resources like CSS
sheets:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('css/mobile.css')|nocache }}
{% endraw %}

By default, it will use a parameter `t` and the current timestamp. You can
override that behaviour by specifying them directory:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('css/mobile.css')|nocache('v', 5) }}
{% endraw %}


### Formatting filters

You can format a small amount of text by applying one of the formatting filters:

{% raw %}
    {{ post.title|markdown }}
{% endraw %}

Specific filters are available:

* `markodwn` will run Markdown on the text.
* `textile` will run Textile one the text.
* `formatwith(blah)` will run the formatter whose name is `blah`.


### Syntax highlighting

If you're inserting source code into a page, you can make it pretty by using
syntax highlighting on it. **PieCrust** uses [GeSHi][] for that, and it should
support most of the languages you're likely to need.

In **Twig**, you can use the `geshi` tag, followed by the language name, to
specify a portion of text to process. For example, here's how you can add some
PHP code:

{% raw %}
    {% geshi 'php' %}
    include 'foo.php';
    function bar() { echo 'Bar'; }
    {% endgeshi %}
{% endraw %}

You can pass options to a `geshi` block:

* `use_classes`: tells Geshi to use CSS classes instead of inline styles. This reduces the amount of generated HTML, but you'll have to output the Geshi CSS stylesheet somewhere on your page with the {% raw %}`{{geshi_css()}}`{% endraw %} method.
* `line_numbers`: tells Geshi to output line numbers.

So for example, if you want to use line numbers and CSS classes, you would do:

{% raw %}
    {% geshi 'php' line_numbers use_classes %}
    $foo = 42;
    {% endgeshi %}
{% endraw %}


### Temporary cache

When you're baking a website, you may make **PieCrust** do the same thing over and over again for every page. For example, you may have a tag cloud in a sidebar that you generate like this:

{% raw %}
    {% for t in log.tags if t.post_count > 2 %}
    <span style="font-size: {{ t.post_count/2 + 10 }}pt"><a href="{{ pctagurl(t.name) }}">{{t.name}}</a></span>&nbsp;({{t.post_count}}) 
    {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}

This is a lot of work that will produce *the exact same output* on every page during a bake. So you can cache this for the duration of the bake by wrapping it in a `pccache` statement:

{% raw %}
    {% pccache 'tag-cloud' %}
    {% for t in log.tags if t.post_count > 2 %}
    <span style="font-size: {{ t.post_count/2 + 10 }}pt"><a href="{{ pctagurl(t.name) }}">{{t.name}}</a></span>&nbsp;({{t.post_count}}) 
    {% endfor %}
    {% endpccache %}
{% endraw %}

You provide a key for `pccache` (in the example above: `tag-cloud`) and the first time it encounters it, it will proceed and execute the block inside `pccache` as usual. The next time, however, it will reuse the results that it cached the first time.

This can dramatically improve baking times, but should only be used for things that would truly have the same output each time.

This cache is only valid for duration of a bake, and `pccache` does nothing during `chef serve` (it will always let the inner block execute).


### Tag stripping

The `striptag` filter will strip any HTML tags found at the beginning or end of the given string.

For example, this will just print `wrapped in plastic` (without the `<p>` tags):

{% raw %}
    {{ "<p>wrapped in plastic</p>"|striptag }}
{% endraw %}

You can specify a tag to strip, if only that tag must be removed:

{% raw %}
    {{ "<p>wrapped in plastic</p>"|striptag('p') }}
{% endraw %}


### External text import

The `textfrom` function will output text from an external file:

{% raw %}
    {{ textfrom("~/Dropbox/Drafts/my-fancy-post.txt")|raw }}
{% endraw %}

This is useful when, for example, you want to preview a post draft currently located somewhere else, like a [Dropbox][] folder.
