**PieCrust** adds a few functions to **Twig** by default. They greatly help with
authoring a website.


### URL functions

You can easily insert the URL to a page without having to think about whether
you have [pretty URLs][1] enabled or not, or if it's for a baked website or
whatever. That's done with the `pcurl` function:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('my/page' }}
{% endraw %}

Similarly to the `pcurl` function, the `pctagurl` and `pccaturl` functions will
generate URLs to a [tag or category listing page][2] with respect to the site
configuration:

{% raw %}
    {{ pctagurl('sometag' }}
    {{ pccaturl('category' }}
{% endraw %}

Last but not least, the `pcposturl` function generates the URL to a post given a
year, month, day and name. It will take into account the [posts file-system][3]
when generating the URL:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcposturl(2011, 11, 21, 'some-post') }}
{% endraw %}

Those functions will update their output automatically if you change the posts,
tags or categories URL formats.


### Word count function

The `wordcount(text)` function counts the number of words in the given text.


### Nocache filter

This filter adds an URL query parameter of the form `?t=12345` at the end of the
provided text. This is useful to prevent caching on updated resources like CSS
sheets:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('css/mobile.css')|nocache }}
{% endraw %}

By default, it will use a parameter `t` and the current timestamp. You can
override that behaviour by specifying them directory:

{% raw %}
    {{ pcurl('css/mobile.css')|nocache('v', 5) }}
{% endraw %}


### Formatting filters

You can format a small amount of text by applying one of the formatting filters:

{% raw %}
    {{ post.title|markdown }}
{% endraw %}

Specific filters are availebl:

* `markodwn` will run Markdown on the text.
* `textile` will run Textile one the text.
* `formatwith(blah)` will run the formatter whose name is `blah`.


### Syntax highlighting

If you're inserting source code into a page, you can make it pretty by using
syntax highlighting on it. **PieCrust** uses [GeSHi][] for that, and it should
support most of the languages you're likely to need.

In **Twig**, you can use the `geshi` tag, followed by the language name, to
specify a portion of text to process. For example, here's how you can add some
PHP code:

{% raw %}
    {% geshi 'php' %}
    include 'foo.php';
    function bar() { echo 'Bar'; }
    {% endgeshi %}
{% endraw %}
