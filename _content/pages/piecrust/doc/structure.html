### PieCrust folders

A **PieCrust** website usually looks like this:

    (root)
     |-- _cache
     |-- _content
           |-- pages
           |-- posts
           |-- templates
           |-- config.yml
     |-- css
     |-- images
     |-- js

The only folders **PieCrust** cares about in your website are the `_cache` and
`_content` folders. The other ones are up to you -- organize it the same way you
would organize any other website.

The cache folder should be writeable, because it's where **PieCrust** will store
pre-rendered parts of your pages, among other things, to render or bake stuff
faster. **PieCrust** will make it writeable if it's not the case, and display an
error if it can't do it.

The `_content` folder contains any of the following pre-defined folders (not all of
them may exist if you don't need them):

* `pages`: That's where you put all your pages. Sub-folders here will map to
sub-folders in the URL needed to access the page. See [how to create a page][4]
for more information.
* `posts`: That's where you put your blog posts. You need to organize this
folder by following a year/month/day convention. See [how to create a blog
post][5] for more information.
* `templates`: That's where you put the layouts and other reusable bits for your
website. See the [templates][6] documentation.
* `plugins`: That's where you install [plugins][7].

There's also the very important `config.yml` file, which contains information
about your website like its title and how you want its contents to be formatted.
It's the only truly required file. See the [configuration documentation]({{
pcurl('piecrust/doc/config') }}).

All the rest, like your `css` or `images` folders, will be left untouched by
**PieCrust**.


### Recommended folder structures

If you need some recommendations, keep reading. If you like to do things your
way, just skip this part.

We like to keep all our stuff in a `_kitchen` directory, like this:

    (root)
     |-- _piecrust
     |-- _kitchen
     |     |-- mywebsite
     |          |-- _cache
     |          |-- _content
     |          |-- etc...
     |-- mywebsite.com

The `_kitchen/mywebsite` folder can be served with the _[chef][3]_ development
server. Then you bake that into the actual `mywebsite.com` folder, which is
accessible from the internet. You can alternatively bake it in the default
folder, `_kitchen/mywebsite/_counter` and copy that to your web server.

If you have multiple websites, you can share things like plugins and templates
like this:

    (root)
     |-- _piecrust
     |-- _kitchen
           |-- shared_templates
           |-- shared_plugins
           |-- website1
           |-- website2

Each website can then import the shared templates and plugins by specifying
those shared folders in their configuration:

    site:
        templates_dirs: ../shared_templates
        plugins_dirs: ../shared_plugins

        
#### "Dynamic" websites

If you will be using **PieCrust** directly on your web server like a lightweight
CMS, your website would ideally be organized as follows:

    (root)
     |-- _piecrust
     |-- mywebsite.com
          |-- _cache
          |-- _content
          |-- etc...
          |-- index.php
          |-- .htaccess

The `_piecrust` folder would contain, unsurprisingly, the **PieCrust** engine.

The `mywebsite.com` folder would be the folder actually accessible from the
internet. Note how the **PieCrust** folder is not accessible from outside. It's
better to do it this way since it exposes less information to the internet, and
makes your websites a bit more secure.

Depending on where you host your website, however, you may not be able to
organize things like this because you only have access to your website's folder,
not to a parent folder. In that case, put the `_piecrust` folder into your
website's folder (next to `_content`), or consider [baking][2] your website.
