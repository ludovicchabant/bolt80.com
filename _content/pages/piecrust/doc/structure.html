### "Dynamic" websites

If you will be using **PieCrust** directly on your web server like a lightweight CMS, your website would ideally be organized as follows:

    (root)
     |-- _piecrust
     |-- mywebsite.com
          |-- _cache
          |-- _content
                |-- pages
                |-- posts
                |-- templates
                |-- config.yml
          |-- css
          |-- images
          |-- js
          |-- index.php
          |-- .htaccess
          |-- web.config

The `_piecrust` folder contains, surprisingly, the **PieCrust** engine. When you update **PieCrust**, you overwrite this folder.

The `mywebsite.com` folder would be the folder actually accessible from the internet. Note how the **PieCrust** folder is not accessible from outside. It's better to do it this way since it exposes less information to the internet, and makes your websites a bit more secure.

> #### A note about some hosting services
>
> Depending on where you host your websites, you may not be able to organize things as shown previously because you only have access to your website's folder, not to a parent folder. In that case, put the `_piecrust` folder into your website's folder (next to `_content`), or consider [baking][2] your website.


### Baked websites

If you plan to [bake your website][2] instead of having it dynamically generated, a slightly different folder structure is recommended:

    (root)
     |-- _piecrust
     |-- _kitchen
     |     |-- mywebsite
     |          |-- _cache
     |          |-- _content
     |                |-- pages
     |                |-- posts
     |                |-- templates
     |                |-- config.yml
     |          |-- css
     |          |-- images
     |          |-- js
     |-- mywebsite.com

You would keep all your content in a `_kitchen` folder that you can serve with any PHP-enabled web server on your local machine, or with the _[chef][3]_ development server. Then you would bake the contents of the "_kitchen_" into the actual `mywebsite.com` folder, which is accessible from the internet.


### PieCrust folders

The only folders **PieCrust** cares about in your website are the `_cache` and `_content` folders.

The cache folder should be writeable, as it's there **PieCrust** will store pre-rendered parts of your pages, among other things, to render or bake stuff faster. **PieCrust** will make it writeable if it's not the case, and display an error if it can't do it.

The content folder contains the following pre-defined folders:

* "_pages_": That's where you put all your pages. Sub-folders here will map to sub-folders in the URL needed to access the page. See [how to create a page]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/create-page') }}) for more information.
* "_posts_": That's where you put your blog posts and articles. You need to organize this folder by following a year/month/day convention. See [how to create a blog post]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/create-post') }}) for more information.
* "_templates_": That's where you put the layouts for your website. See the [templates]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/templates') }}) documentation.

There's also the very important `config.yml` file, which contains information about your website like its title and how you want its contents to be formatted. See the [configuration documentation]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/config') }}).

All the rest, like your `css` or `images` folders, will be left untouched by **PieCrust**.
