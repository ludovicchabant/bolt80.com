**PieCrust** supports plugins for adding [formatters][1], [template engines][2],
[file processors][3] and even [chef commands][4] to your websites.

Plugins are just a bunch of files that you copy in a sub-folder of your
`_content/plugins` folder. For example:

    _content
      |- pages
           |- ...pages here...
      |- plugins
           |- Dwoo
           |    |- ...dwoo plugin files here...

Here, your website has one plugin installed: the [Dwoo][] template engine.


### Sharing plugins

You may not want to have all your plugins installed in your website -- maybe you
want to share some plugins between several websites. In that case, you can
specify additional plugins folders with the `site/plugins_dirs` [configuration
setting][5]. Paths can be written relative to the website's root:

    site:
        plugins_dirs:
            - ../shared/plugins
            - /usr/local/lib/piecrust/plugins

### Built-in plugin

The built-in plugin, called `__builtin__`, is the plugin that ships with
**PieCrust**. It defines all the [_chef_][4] commands, the Twig and Mustache
template engines, the Markdown, Textile and SmartyPants formatters, and the
LessCSS, Sitemap and plain copy file processors.
