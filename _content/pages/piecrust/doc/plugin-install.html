Installing a **PieCrust** plugin is pretty simple: create a sub-folder in
`_content/plugins` and copy all the plugin's files in there. That's it!

    _content
      |- plugins
           |- MyPlugin
                |- ...plugin files here...

You can name the plugin folder anything you want, but it's obviously a good idea
to give it the name of the plugin you're installing.

You can see what plugins are loaded by your website with the `chef plugins`
command -- this is especially useful if you're [loading plugins from other
locations][1] than the default one.
