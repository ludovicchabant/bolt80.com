title: Enabling pretty URLs
layout: piecrust_doc

### Baked websites

With "*pretty URLs*" disabled, a baked "*about*" page's address would look like this:

    http://yoursite.com/about.html

If the option is enabled, however, it would look like this:

    http://yoursite.com/about

This obviously looks more "natural" to visitors, and it only requires you to set the `pretty_urls` [site configuration setting][siteconfig] to `true`:

    site:
        pretty_urls: true



### Dynamic websites (PieCrust as a CMS)

With "*pretty URLs*" disabled, an "*about*" page's address would look like this:

    http://yoursite.com/?/about

If the option is enabled, however, it would look like this:

    http://yoursite.com/about
    
This obviously looks more "natural" to visitors, but it requires a bit of configuration, especially on the server side.

To use pretty URLs you need a web-server with URL rewriting features. The ones supported out-of-the-box by **PieCrust**
are [Apache][] and [IIS7][].

* *At home*: if you've installed your web-server using some pre-packaged tool like [MAMP][], [XAMPP][]
    or [WAMP][], you're running **Apache**. If you're on **Windows Vista** or **Windows 7** and you're 
    using the built-in web-server, that's **IIS7**.
* *On the web*: if you're hosting your website with services like [Dreamhost][], [Bluehost][], [NearlyFreeSpeech][]
    or [HostGator][], chances are your website is running with **Apache**.

#### On Apache

1. Open the `.htaccess` file at the root of your website folder.
1. Uncomment the line that says `RewriteEngine on` (remove the `#` character at the beginning of the line).
1. If your **PieCrust** website is not at the root of your domain (e.g. you want to access it at `http://domain.com/piecrust/`),
   also uncomment the line that says `RewriteBase /piecrust`, and replace "*piecrust*" with the name
   of your sub-directory.
1. In your `config.yml`, in the `site` section, set `pretty_urls` to `true` (check out the documenation
   about [your website's configuration][siteconfig] to see how to do this).
   
If links on your website are suddenly broken, check that you've got the correct rewrite-base (step 3, above), and
check (or have an admin check for you) that you have the `mod_rewrite` extension enabled.


#### On IIS7

1. Open the `web.config` file at the root of your domain.
1. Uncomment the `rewrite` section (remove lines 8 and 23 completely).
