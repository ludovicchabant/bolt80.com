Creating a **PieCrust** theme is pretty much like creating a website. There are
only a few differences, listed on the [theme documentation page][0].

The main differences are the name of the configuration file, which is
`_content/theme_config.yml` for themes, and the requirement of a
`theme_info.yml` file in the root directory of the theme.


### Theme metadata

The `theme_info.yml` file describes the theme and gives some important
information about how to install it. It should be a YAML file, just like
`theme_config.yml`, with the following settings:

* `name`: the name of the theme. That's what users will refer to when
installing it.

* `description`: a short description of the theme.

* `authors`: an array of names, preferably in the `Firstname Lastname
<email@provider.com>` form.

* `url`: a link to a website pertaining to the theme.

* `requires`: an array of plugin names that should be installed along with the
  theme.

Only the `name` and `description` settings are required, but you're encouraged
to also provide `authors` and `url`.
