There are typically a few pages that need to display a list of articles, like
the main page of a blog. To do this in **PieCrust**, you can use the
`pagination` variable on a page. For example, if you're using the default
template engine **Twig**:

{% raw %}
    {% for post in pagination.posts %}
    ## [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.uri }})
    <span class="post-date">{{ post.date }}</span>
    {{ post.content|raw }}
    {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}

This will display a list of posts, and for each display the title with a link to
the article, followed by the date and the excerpts.

What **PieCrust** does is merely expose pagination values to the template
engine, and you can use them in any way you like. Check the [Twig
documentation][twigdoc] to find out what you can do. Read on to see what properties are available on the `pagination` variable.

Note that the `pagination` variable is called like that because it will
*paginate* the current page by creating sub-pages (see below). If you want to
display pages with a list of posts _without_ any pagination (_i.e._ without any
sub-page), you can either set `single_page` to `true` in the [page
configuration][1], or use the [blog archive variables][3] like `blog.posts`
instead.


### Pagination filtering

If you want to create a page that lists only specific posts, you can filter what
you get from the `pagination` object. You do this with the `posts_filters`
[configuration section][1] in your page.

For example:

    posts_filters:
        has_tags: announcement
        has_tags: piecrust
    
...will only return posts with the `announcement` and `piecrust` tags.

For more information on the `posts_filters` syntax, read the documentation 
on [post filtering][5].


### Sub-pages

Most pages don't have sub-pages -- there's just the page. However, pages that
show a list of blog posts could have sub-pages if there are too many blog posts.

For example, if you only show 5 posts per page and you have written 17 posts in
total, your blog's main page would have 4 sub-pages: sub-page 1 would show posts
17 to 13, sub-page 2 would show posts 12 to 7, etc. (posts are sorted in
reverse-chronological order). The visitor would then click on "*previous
entries*" and "*next entries*" links to navigate back and forth.

If a page's URL is `domain.com/blog`, its 3rd sub-page's URL would look like
`domain.com/blog/3`. This means it's a bad idea to create an actual page whose
name is just a number!


### Pagination reference

#### Pagination object reference

Here's a list of variables accessible on the `pagination` object:

* `posts`: That's the list of blog posts for the current page. The number of
posts in the list is at most `posts_per_page`, as defined in either the
[page][1]'s or the [site][2]'s configuration. **PieCrust** takes care of
returning the correct posts if the current page is a sub-page (e.g. page #2 of
your blog's main page). This object is actually a [post iterator][4], which has
properties and methods of its own.

* `prev_page`: The URL of the previous sub-page, if any. You need to prepend `site.root` to it, or pass it to `pcurl()` to get an absolute URL.

* `this_page`: The URL of this sub-page. You need to prepend `site.root` to it, or pass it to `pcurl()` to get an absolute URL.

* `next_page`: The URL of the next sub-page, if any. You need to prepend `site.root` to it, or pass it to `pcurl()` to get an absolute URL.

* `posts_per_page`: The effective number of posts to be theoritically displayed
on the page.

* `posts_this_page`: The actual number of posts displayed on this page (can be
  anything between 1 and `posts_per_page`).

* `prev_page_number`: The previous sub-page number, if any.

* `this_page_number`: The current sub-page number, if any.

* `next_page_number`: The next sub-page number, if any.

* `total_post_count`: The total number of posts across all sub-pages.

* `total_page_count`: The total number of sub-pages.

* `next_post`: The next post object.

* `prev_post`: The previous post object.

* `all_page_numbers`: Returns the list of page numbers. For example, if the current page has 4 sub-pages, this will return: 1, 2, 3, 4. You can loop through that and use the `page(i)` method (see below).

* `page(i)`: Returns the URL of a given sub-page (the index should be between 1 and the last sub-page). You need to prepend `site.root` to it, or pass it to `pcurl()` to get an absolute URL.
