When you [write a post][1] you can specify a category and some tags to classify it. You can later list all the posts with a specific tag or in given category using the special `_tag` and `_category` pages. Those pages are in the regular `_content/pages` folder and are just like any other page, except that when accessed from the correct address, the [pagination data][2] passed to them will only contain the appropriate posts.

The address at which you access tag or category listings is defined in the [site configuration][3] with the `tag_url` and `category_url` settings. For example, if you want tag "*food*" to be reached at `http://domain.com/blog/tag/food`, you could configure your site like this:

    site:
        tag_url: 'blog/tag/%tag%'

For the tag and category URL settings, the patterns `%tag%` and `%category%`, respectively, must be specified somewhere in the value.

The `tag` and `category` variables will be respecitvely exposed to the template system for the `_tag` and `_category` pages.
