When [baking your website][baking], [_chef_][chef] transforms all the
**PieCrust** content (pages, posts, _etc._) into fully rendered HTML files.
However, it can do something with all the other files found in the root
directory: copy them to the output directory, of course, but also transform them
some way or another. That's what _file processors_ do.


### Including and excluding files

By default, _chef_ ignores the **PieCrust** directories (`_content`, `_cache`,
`_counter`) along with common system and revision control files: `.DS_Store`,
`Thumbs.db`, `.git`, `.hg` and `.svn`. Everything else gets processed.

You can tell **PieCrust** to skip some other files if you don't want them to be
processed or copied to the output directory. You do this with the
`baker/skip_patterns` [configuration setting][siteconfig]. For example:

    baker:
        skip_patterns:
            - /_[^\/]+\.s?ss/
            - index.php
            - .htaccess
            - web.config

Any pattern that begins and ends with a `/` will be treated as a regular
expression. All other patterns are treated like classic UNIX [_glob_
patterns][1]. Patterns are matched against the website root-relative path of
each file. The default patterns, mentioned earlier, are always applied.


### Processing files

The [_chef_][chef] baker figures out what to do with a file based on the file's
extension. That extension is passed on to the registered file processors to see
who first declares it can handle it. The list of file processors to use is found
in the [site configuration][siteconfig]'s  `processors` setting in the `baker`
section. By default, it has the special value `*`, which means all file
processors will be used:

    baker:
        processors: *

You can however specify processors individually:

    baker:
        processors: [ less, copy ]


> **Note**: If you specify processors individually in the site configuration,
> you _probably_ don't want to forget the `copy` processor in the list.
> Otherwise, all the files not compiled by a listed processor will be missing
> from the output directory!

### Processors

Here's a list of file processors included with **PieCrust**, along with some
information on how to use them.

#### Copy processor

The `copy` processor simply copies the file to the matching sub-directory in the
output baking directory. This processor has low priority so it will be used only
if no other processor matched the given file extension.

#### LessCSS processor

The `less` processor compiles all `.less` files into CSS files using the
[LessCSS](http://lesscss.org/) language. **PieCrust** uses
[LessPHP](http://leafo.net/lessphp/docs/) for this.

#### Sitemap processor

The `sitemap` processor compiles any file with a `.sitemap` extension into an XML
file with the [sitemap markup][2]. The input file must be written in YAML syntax
with a list of `locations` that each define a URL along with optional
properties:

* `lastmod`: the last modification time of the location. By default, it will be
  file modification time of the **PieCrust** page whose URL is the location URL,
  if such a page can be found.
* `lastmod_path`: specify the root-relative path to a file whose modification
  time should be used for `lastmod`.
* `changefreq`: the frequency of changes for the location. Should be one of the
  frequency names accepted by the [sitemap syntax][2].
* `priority`: the priority of that location relative to the other locations in
  the website. See the [sitemap protocol][2] for more information.

Here's an example of a sitemap file:

    locations:
        - url: /
        - url: piecrust
          changefreq: weekly
        - url: stupidhttp
          changefreq: monthly
          priority: 0.2
