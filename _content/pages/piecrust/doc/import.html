Because you may want to transition an existing website to **PieCrust**, the _chef_ utility has a special command for importing content from other engines.

> Unfortunately, right now, the only supported import is importing blog posts from a **Wordpress** site.

Running the import is done like this:

    chef import --source SOURCE --format FORMAT /path/to/root/directory

Where `SOURCE` is the path or resource string to the content to import, and `FORMAT` is the format of that content.


Formats
-------

### Wordpress

By specifying `wordpress` as the format, you can point the source to an XML file that contains your **Wordpress** content. You can create that XML file by going into your website's administration panel, going in the "_Tools_" sections and choosing "_Export_".

This will import all your blog posts, along with tags, last modification time, _etc._, into the specified **PieCrust** root directory. The directory structure used for the imported content is determined by the [site configuration][siteconfig]'s setting regarding the [posts file system][post].



  [post]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/create-post') }}
  [siteconfig]: {{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/site-config') }}
