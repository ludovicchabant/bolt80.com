By default, a **PieCrust** website has one unique blog or news feed, but you can have several separate ones if you need it. It works like this:

1. Define your blog names in the [site configuration][config]:
    
        site:
            blogs: [ pro, family ]
    
1. Move your posts inside [subdirectories][structure] named after each blog name. So instead of having all your posts inside the `_content/posts` folder, you would have some posts under `_content/posts/pro`, and other posts under `_content/posts/family`, depending on which blog they belong to.
    
    Note that the post URLs will always be prefixed with the blog name, so choose it accordingly. For example, you would get URLs like this:
    
        http://domain.com/family/2011/07/12/my-kid-just-turned-2/
        http://domain.com/pro/2011/07/12/troubleshooting-xzy-errors-with-abc/

1. If you want to configure each blog differently, specify configuration settings in a section named after the blog in the [site configuration][config]. For example, here's how you keep the same date format between your 2 blogs, but with a different number of posts per page:
    
        site:
            blogs: [ pro, family ]
            date_format: 'F j, Y'
        
        pro:
            posts_per_page: 20
        
        family:
            posts_per_page: 6
    
    Settings that you can configure either at the `site` or blog level are: `post_url`, `tag_url`, `category_url`, `posts_per_page` and `date_format`. The first 3 settings (URL formats) will be automatically prefixed with the blog name, as mentioned in the previous point. Note that the `posts_fs` setting can't be overriden -- it would be confusing to have posts organized differently between blogs.
    
1. If you create a new page that lists posts (e.g. the main page, or the RSS feed page), you can specify what blog to take posts from with the `blog` setting in the page's [configuration header][pageconfig]:
    
        blog: family
    
    By default, all pages take posts from the first declared blog.
