**PieCrust** includes a small development web server for previewing your
website. Since **PieCrust** also works as a standard, lightweight CMS, you could
preview your website with any other web server like **Apache**, **IIS** or
**Lighttpd**. Here are some advantages to using the development server:

* No setup or configuration needed, you just run it from the command line!
* If you're [baking your site][baking], you don't need to maintain an
  `index.php` file, along with a `.htaccess` or `web.config`, that you then need
  to exclude from the baking.
* If you're [baking your site][baking] and rely on [file processors][procs], the
  development server can re-bake your website on-demand to generate those output
  files. With another server, you would get `404` ("_not found_") errors unless
  you somehow write your own request handlers to trigger a baking.

Here are the disadvantages:

* The development server uses the [StupidHttp][] library, which is pretty
  retarded (we know, we wrote it ourselves!). It has a very limited support of
  the HTTP protocol so it will only work with the purely **PieCrust**-powered
  parts of your website (_e.g._ if you have other parts of your website that
  work with custom PHP files, you won't be able to test that in the development
  server).
* Although there's a plan to fix that in the future, right now the development
  server can't run [file processors][procs]. This means that if you're using
  things like Sass, you may not be able to preview your website correctly.


### Running the server

The server is run through [_chef_][chef] with the `serve` command. Type `chef
serve --help` for a detailed usage.

In the most simple case, serving your website is done with a quick `chef serve`,
assuming you're somewhere in your website. This would launch your default
browser and navigate to `localhost:8080`, where your website can be previewed.
