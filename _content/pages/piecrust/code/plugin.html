**PieCrust**` supports [plugins][4] since version 0.4.0. With plugins, you can add your own [formatters][1], [template engines][2] or [file processors][3] to your websites. You can even extend Twig with more functions.

### The plugin class

You start by creating a folder named after your plugin in the `_content/plugins`
directory -- or any other directory specified in the `site/plugins_dirs` site
configuration setting. Let's assume your plugin is named `Foo`.

In the `_content/plugins/Foo` directory, create a `FooPlugin.php` file with a
`FooPlugin` class inheriting `PieCrust\PieCrustPlugin`:

{% geshi 'php' %}
use PieCrust\PieCrustPlugin;

class FooPlugin extends PieCrustPlugin
{
    public function getName()
    {
        return 'Foo';
    }
}
{% endgeshi %}

You just need to override the `getName` function to make it work, and you have a
nice, completely useless, plugin. You can check that everything is good by
running `chef plugins` from within your website's root. You should get the
following:

    __builtin__
    Foo

This shows that you have both the built-in plugin and your own `Foo` one.


### Plugin structure and environment

A good practice for creating plugins is to arrange them as follows:

    Foo
     |- libs
     |   |- DependencyLib1
     |   `- DependencyLib2
     |
     |- src
     |   |- SomeCode.php
     |   `- SomeOtherCode.php
     |
     `- FooPlugin.php

The `libs` folder should contain any dependency the plugin has. Right now,
**PieCrust** automatically adds this folder, if it exists, to PHP's
`include_path` so you can easily include stuff from there.

The `src` folder should contain the actual code for the plugin. That's where you
would put the classes for any custom formatter or template engine you wrote.


### Adding components

You can now go read up on adding [formatters][5], [template engines][6],
[processors][7], or [Twig extensions][8] to the basic **PieCrust**
feature set.
