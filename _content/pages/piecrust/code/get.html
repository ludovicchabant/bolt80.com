**PieCrust**'s code is available on [BitBucket][] and mirrored on [GitHub][].

It's organized in 2 branches:

* `default` (or `master`): the default branch contains the newest version of **PieCrust**.
  It may be unstable, may have undocumented features and backward compatibility breaks.
* `stable`: the, well, stable branch. This is where you'll find the tags for each "official"
  version of the application. You probably want this branch if posting bug reports or
  submitting patches doesn't sound so exciting to you.

If you want to get only the **PieCrust** app as a sub-repository, clone the [PieCrust_App][app]
repository.
