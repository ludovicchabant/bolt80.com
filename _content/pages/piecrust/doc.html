Using **PieCrust** is mostly a matter of editing text files.

Configurations are written in [YAML][], a simple human-readable syntax, templating is handled by default by [Twig][], with a syntax similar to [Jinja][] or [Django][], and text formatting is done by default through [Markdown], which makes page contents look like what you'd naturally write in an email.
