Using **PieCrust** is mostly a matter of editing text files.

The application's code itself, of course, is a bunch of text files. It's standalone, so you don't have any dependencies to install.

Your website will also be mostly text files. Configurations are written in [YAML][], a simple human-readable syntax. Templating is handled by default by [Twig][], with a syntax similar to [Jinja][] or [Django][]. Text formatting is done by default through [Markdown], which lets you write page contents the same way you would naturally write an email.

If you don't know any of those names I mentioned, __*don't panic*__! [Keep reading][1], you'll see it's easy.



### Requirements

**PieCrust** only requires a web-server running [PHP 5.3+][php] for dynamically rendered websites. If you [bake] your website, however, all you need is a web-server that can serve HTML files, and that's by definition _any_ web server! You can't make it simpler (although of course you'll need some computer with PHP somewhere to do the baking in the first place).
