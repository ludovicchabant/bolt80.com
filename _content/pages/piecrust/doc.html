Using **PieCrust** is mostly a matter of editing text files.

Configurations are written in [YAML][], a simple human-readable syntax. Templating is handled by default by [Twig][], with a syntax similar to [Jinja][] or [Django][]. Text formatting is done by default through [Markdown], which lets you write page contents like you would naturally write an email.

If you don't know any of those names I mentioned, _DON'T PANIC_! [Keep reading][1], you'll see it's easy.
