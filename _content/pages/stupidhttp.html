title: A super simple (and not very smart) HTTP library for PHP
---
**StupidHttp** is the stupidest HTTP library for PHP ever (or for any other language, for that matter). The problem is, as far as I can tell, there's not really any other such library for PHP anyway, so I could say it's also the best one, but that would be a big lie. Truth is, **StupidHttp** _is_ stupid. Take a look at what it does:

* Runs a local HTTP server.
    * Tries to support `HTTP/1.0` and `HTTP/1.1` persistent connections (`keep-alive`).
* Serves existing files in the document root folder.
    * Handles the usual MIME types.
    * Handles `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match`/`Etag` HTML headers.
* Lets you map URLs and URL patterns to custom callbacks.
    * Callbacks output whatever should be shown in the client browser.
    * Callbacks can set HTML response headers.

That's it. That's all it does. It does not support _anything_ else, so obviously it's nice for running a small embedded development web server in a PHP application, but it's absolutely not suited for anything with more than a couple of clients connected at once, let alone for being exposed to the internet or other sensitive network (I'm sure this thing is full of security holes since I haven't made any effort in securing it in the first place).

Remember, it's all in the name.

Here's a quick preview of how it looks like to run a development web server with **StupidHttp**:

{% geshi 'php' %}
    $server = new StupidHttp_WebServer('/path/to/document/root', 8080);
    $server->on('GET', '/')
           ->call(function($c) { echo 'Hello from StupidHttp!'; });
    $server->onPattern('GET', '/hello/(.+)')
           ->call(function($c, $m) { echo 'Hello, ' . $m[1]; });
    $server->run();
{% endgeshi %}
