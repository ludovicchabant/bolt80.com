title: A super simple (and not very smart) HTTP server for PHP
---
**StupidHttp** is the stupidest HTTP server library for PHP ever. The problem is, as far as I can tell, the only other remotely similar library available is the PEAR `HTTP_Server` library, which was deprecated, like, in the 16th century or something. It still works, but it's got lots of dependencies on other PEAR packages, and PHP hipsters (yes, there is such a thing apparently) haven't used PEAR since some time around 1972.

As a result of this, and a rather quiet winter week-end, **StupidHttp** was born.


Get It
------

**StupidHttp** is available from both [Github][] and [Bitbucket][], and also on [Packagist][] if you're using [Composer][].


  [github]: https://github.com/ludovicchabant/StupidHttp
  [bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/stupidhttp
  [packagist]: http://packagist.org/packages/bolt80/stupidhttp
  [composer]: http://getcomposer.org


Use It
------

Running a development web server with **StupidHttp** is stupidly easy:

{% geshi 'php' %}
    $server = new StupidHttp_WebServer('/path/to/document/root', 8080);
    $server->on('GET', '/')
           ->call(function($c) { echo 'Hello from StupidHttp!'; });
    $server->onPattern('GET', '/hello/(.+)')
           ->call(function($c, $m) { echo 'Hello, ' . $m[1]; });
    $server->run();
{% endgeshi %}

Yes, it does exactly what you expect:

* Display `Hello from StupidHttp!` when you hit the home page (`localhost:8080`).
* Display `Hello, Dave` when you go to `localhost:8080/hello/Dave`.
* Serve files in `/path/to/document/root` if the relative URL matches a file.


More Examples
-------------

The source code comes with several examples in the appropriately named `examples` directory. Run them, they are pretty self-explanatory.


Technical Details
-----------------

Here's what **StupidHttp** does for you:

* Runs a local HTTP server.
    * Tries to support `HTTP/1.0` and `HTTP/1.1` persistent connections (`keep-alive`).
* Serves existing files in the document root folder.
    * Handles the usual MIME types.
    * Handles `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match`/`Etag` HTML headers.
* Lets you map URLs and URL patterns to custom callbacks.
    * Callbacks output whatever should be shown in the client browser.
    * Callbacks can set HTML response headers.

That's it. That's all it does. It does not support _anything_ else, so obviously it's nice for running a small embedded development web server in a PHP application, but it's absolutely not suited for anything with more than a couple of clients connected at once, let alone for being exposed to the internet or other sensitive network (I'm sure this thing is full of security holes since I haven't made any effort in securing it in the first place).

Remember, it's all in the name.
