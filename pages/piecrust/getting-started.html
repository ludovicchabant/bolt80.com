This tutorial will help you install **PieCrust** and show you the basics of setting up a simple website.


### Installation

The first step is obviously to get **PieCrust** on your system (need I say you'll only have to do this once?). The easiest way is to install it with `pip`.


#### Installing from the sources

You can also run **PieCrust** from the source. Get it from [GitHub][] or [BitBucket][] using, respectively, Git or Mercurial, or [download a snapshot](https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/piecrust/get/stable.zip) of the latest code.

[github]: https://github.com/ludovicchabant/PieCrust
[bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/ludovicchabant/piecrust


### Check your install

After you're done downloading **PieCrust**, check that it works by running `chef`:

* If you used the installer script, the `chef` bootstrap script should have been created next to `piecrust.phar`, in the current directory.
* If you installed the **PieCrust** sources, the `chef` script is in the `bin` directory (on Windows, you'll run `bin/chef.cmd`, and on Mac/Linux you'll run `bin/chef`).

Running `chef` without any other argument should output some help information.

> It's a good idea to make your **PieCrust** installation available from anywhere, otherwise you'll have to call `chef` using its absolute path all the time.
>
> You do this by adding the path to `chef` to your `PATH` environment variable. If you don't know how to do it, the internet is [wonderful place][path] for this kind of question.

### Create an empty website

Now it's time to create a website! While still in your Terminal or Command Prompt window, go to a directory you like and type something like:

    chef init rhubarbpie

This initializes a new website in a directory called `rhubarbpie` located in the current directory (the one from which you ran the `chef` command). You should be able to preview it right away:

    cd rhubarbpie
    chef serve

This will launch your default web browser and show you the placeholder main page.


### Changing the configuration

Let's change a few things. Open the `_content/config.yml` file in a text editor, and change the `site/title` setting to `My Rhubarb Pie Recipe`:

    site:
        title: My Rhubarb Pie Recipe

Refresh your browser and note the new title, both on the page and for the window.


### Adding a blog post

Open a new Terminal or Command Prompt window (so that you can let the `chef serve` command running) and type the following:

    chef prepare post "pie-contest-pictures"

This will create a new blog post, and tell you where to find it. If today is June 5th, 2013, it will tell you it created a file named `_content/posts/2013-06-05_pie-contest-pictures.html`.
    
> The `chef prepare` command just creates a file with the correct name format and a few lines of boilerplate text -- you don't have to use it, you could instead create files manually with your text editor. It's just a nice shortcut.

Open the blog post file and write some text below the second `---` line:

    Lots of pie contest pictures are [available on Flickr][1]. This is an *awesome* source of inspiration for your next baking experiments!

    For example, this looks very yummy:

    <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mjrehm/2898126847/" title="Harvest Festival Pie Baking Contest by nfnitloop, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3050/2898126847_97accb01a2.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Harvest Festival Pie Baking Contest"></a>

    [1]: http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=pie+contest&l=cc&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1

Now refresh your browser and, behold: your blog post!


### Adding a page

Similar to how we created a blog post, we can create a page:

    chef prepare page "about/me"

Again, `chef` will tell you where it created the new page: `_content/pages/about/me.html`

Open that file in a text editor and change the title of the page, as shown below. And while we're at it, change the contents (the text after the second `---` line) to something a bit more personal:

    ---
    title: About The Author
    ---
    I like writing **code**, and I like baking **pies**!

Switch to your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/about/me`. You should see your new page.


### Bake your website

Ok, so your website is not the most awesome website ever yet, but let's bake it into static files anyway:

    chef bake

This should create a `_counter` directory next to the existing `_content`, and you'll see a bunch of directories and files there. You can upload all of that to your web server and you're done! Make sure you upload the _contents_ of the `_counter` directory, and not the directory itself.


### Next steps

Now that you know the basics of **PieCrust**, it's time to dive deeper in the [documentation]({{pcurl('piecrust/doc')}})!
