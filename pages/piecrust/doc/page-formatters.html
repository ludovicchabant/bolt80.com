**PieCrust** ships with 2 formatters out of the box (**Markdown** and
**Textile**), one "complementary" formatter (**SmartyPants**), and a
"pass-through" formatter that doesn't touch your text at all.


### Markdown

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is the default
formatter. This can be changed with the `default_format` setting in the [site
configuration]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/site-config') }}). If you did that, you
can still use **Markdown** for a given page by setting its `format`
[configuration setting]({{ pcurl('piecrust/doc/page-config') }}) to `markdown`.

Because **PieCrust** uses [PHP
Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/), it's possible to use the
[Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/) syntax, which
adds a few non-standard features to the formatter. If you want to use those
extra-features, create a site configuration section called `markdown` and set
`use_markdown_extra` to `true`:

    markdown:
        use_markdown_extra: true


### Textile

[Textile](http://www.textism.com/tools/textile/) is more powerful than
**Markdown** but that means it's also more complicated and less natural to
write. You can use this formatter by setting the page's `format` to `textile`.


### SmartyPants

[SmartyPants](http://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/) will transform
the punctuation on your pages into more typographically accurate characters. For
instance, it will make your quotes prettier and let you easily insert en- and
em-dashes.

**SmartyPants** is not enabled by default. To enable it, create a site
configuration section called `smartypants` with an `enabled` setting set to
`true`:

    smartypants:
        enabled: true

When it's enabled, it will be applied to _all_ pages except those that are not
formatted at all (using the "pass-through" formatter, mentioned below).

Because **PieCrust** uses [PHP
SmartyPants](http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/), it's possible to use
[SmartyPants
Typographer](http://michelf.com/projects/php-smartypants/typographer/), which
adds a few extra features to the standard **SmartyPants** formatting. To use it,
set `use_smartypants_typographer` to `true` in the site configuration:

    smartypants:
        enabled: true
        use_smartypants_typographer: true


### Pass-through

If you don't want a page's contents to be formatted at all, set the `format` to
`none`.
