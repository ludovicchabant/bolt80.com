Writing text is all good, but sometimes you need to add some pictures in your
pages. You could easily handle this yourself by having an `images` folder at the
root of your website with all your pictures in it:

{% raw %}
    ![my picture](/images/path/to/my/picture.png)
{% endraw %}

However, your `images` folder could easily get cluttered and difficult to
organize, especially if you use pictures a lot in your [blog posts][1]. To solve
some of this problem, **PieCrust** has a "_page assets_" mechanism for
"_assets_" (pictures, audio files, etc.) that are only needed for one single
page.


### Using the assets sub-directory

You put all the assets for a page in a sub-directory that has the same name as
the page file, with a `-assets` suffix. For instance, if you have a page at
`_content/about/where-to-find-us.html`, you can create a
`_content/about/where-to-find-us-assets` directory with stuff in it:

    _content
     |- about
         |- where-to-find-us.html
         |- where-to-find-us-assets
             |- map.jpg
             |- street-view.jpg

Then, on the page, you can access those assets with the `assets` variable and the
name of the asset (without the extension):

{% raw %}
    ![map to our place]({{ assets.map }})
    ![our place]({{ assets['street-view'] }})
{% endraw %}


### A note for baked sites

If you [bake your site][2] in a different output folder than your root folder,
**PieCrust** will copy all the assets to the baked page's directory, so this
will still work!
