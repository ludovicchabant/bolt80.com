You can install plugins with the `chef plugins` command:

1. First, you find what plugin you want using `chef plugins find`. It will list all the available plugins based on the `site/plugins_sources` setting. You can optionally pass an argument to filter plugins that match a specific word.

1. Once you know the name of the plugin, you can install it with `chef plugins install <pluginname>`.

You can also later update your installed plugins to their latest version with `chef plugins update`.


### Plugin sources

The `site/plugins_sources` lists the souces from which you can get plugins. **PieCrust** supports only 2 types of sources at the moment:

* *File-system*: a file-system source is defined simply with a path, relative to the root or the website (unless the path itself is an absolute path). Such a plugin source should have available plugins under sub-directories -- each sub-directory being a plugin.

* *Bitbucket*: a Bitbucket source is an URL to a BitBucket account, _i.e._ of the form: `http://bitbucket.org/<username>`. It will look for repositories whose name starts with `PieCrust-Plugin-` and return those as plugins available for install.


### Install plugins manually

Installing a **PieCrust** plugin manually is pretty simple: create a sub-folder in
`_content/plugins` (or any other directory registered with `site/plugins_dirs`) and copy all the plugin's files in there. That's it!

    _content
      |- plugins
           |- MyPlugin
                |- ...plugin files here...

You can name the plugin folder anything you want, but it's obviously a good idea
to give it the name of the plugin you're installing.

Installing plugins manually is required if you want to have them in a non-standard directory, _i.e._ a directory from your `site/plugins_dirs` setting... at least until the `chef plugins` command supports installing anywhere else than `_content/plugins`.
