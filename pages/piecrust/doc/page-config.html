layout: piecrust_doc
title: Page configuration
---

Every page file can have a "header" part in which you specify some configuration
values. This header is written using the [YAML][] syntax, and is delimited with
3 dashes at the beginning and the end. Here's a simple example:

    ---
    title: My awesome new page
    layout: mytemplate
    ---
    Here go the contents of the page.
    Blah blah blah.
    
This header specifies the title for the page ("*My awesome page*") and the
layout to use for rendering that page (templates are covered [later][5]).

Anything you specify here will be exposed to the template system under the
`page` variable, so if you have the following header:

    ---
    foo: bar
    ---

...then you can use `{{ '{{' }} page.foo {{ '}}' }}` several times on the page, and
each time it will be replaced by "bar". Then you can easily replace "bar" with
"beer" in one place. More importantly, that's a way to push stuff "up" to the
layout pages, because all those values will be given to them *via* the template
system. That's for instance how layouts can reference the title of the current
page for the HTML head section.

Again, see the [templating documentation][5] for more info.


### Reference

Here's a list of the system values for a regular page:

* `format`: Specifies the text formatting to use for this page. **PieCrust**
comes built-in with **Markdown** and **Textile** formatters (specify "markdown"
and "textile" respectively). If you don't want any formatting applied, specify
"none".

* `layout`: Specifies the layout to use for this page. **PieCrust** will use the
appropriately named `default` layout if nothing is specified, unless the
current page is a blog post, in which case it will use `post`, if it exists.

* `content_type`: Specified the type of content for the page. Can be html, xml,
text (or txt), css, rss, atom or json. This will tell **PieCrust** to set the
HTTP headers correctly before returning the page. When [baking][4] the site,
this specifies what kind of file extension should be used.

* `date_format`: Specifies the date format for the `date` variable. See [how to
use blog posts][1]. This value overrides the similar value from the [site
configuration][2].

* `posts_per_page`: The number of posts you will get through the `pagination`
for displaying on the current page. See [how to use blog posts][1]. This value
overrides the similar value from the [site configuration][2].

* `single_page`: When this is set to `true`, no sub-pages will be created for
this page, even if there are more posts to show. This is useful for things like
RSS feeds. See [how to use blog posts][1] and [RSS feeds][3].

  Also (and this is a bit convoluted, sorry about that), when baking a page with a [non-HTML extension][7] with [pretty URLs][6] enabled and `single_page` set to `true`, the output name will be simpler (matching the source file name) instead of using a directory with `index.html` in it to allow for sub-pages). See the documentation on [pretty URLs][6] for some more information about this.
