Because you may want to transition an existing website to **PieCrust**, the
_chef_ utility has a special command for importing content from other engines.

Running the import is done like this:

    chef import --source SOURCE --format FORMAT

Here, `SOURCE` is the path or resource string to the content to import, and
`FORMAT` is the format of that content. Type `chef help about-import` to get
more information about those parameters.

Unless you want to merge content into an existing website, you usually run an
import process on an empty **PieCrust** website. To create such an empty
website, you can use the `chef init` command.


#### Imported blog posts

The importers respect the `posts_fs` [configuration setting][post] when
importing content into your website, so it's a good idea to set it accordingly
beforehand.
