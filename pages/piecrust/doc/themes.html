**PieCrust** supports themes to easily apply or change the look of you website.
They also let you further separate content from appearance.


### Theme contents

A theme is really a small **PieCrust** website that will sit in the
`_content/theme` directory of another website. When such a theme is detected, it
will be applied to the main website.

Like a regular website, a theme has a `_content` directory, a configuration
file, pages, templates, and regular assets (Javascript, CSS, images, etc.).

There are a few differences between a theme and a regular website:

* A theme's configuration is named `_content/theme_config.yml`.

* A theme cannot have posts -- just normal pages.

* A theme must have a `theme_info.yml` file in its root directory.


### Applying a theme

When a theme is applied to a website, the following happens:

* The website's configuration file is merged with the theme's. If a setting is
  not specified in the website, it will default to the theme's value first, and
  then only to the default value.

* Some settings will actually be *combined* instead of *overriden*. For example,
  `site/templates_dirs` will be combined so that the site's templates
  directories are added after the theme's. The end result is that if the website
  doesn't define the `default` layout but the theme does, **PieCrust** will use
  that one.

* Themes can define pages, and those will be baked with the rest of the website
  unless a page with the exact same slug (relative path and name) exists in the
  website. This is useful for example if a theme wants to implement a default
  "_about_" page, or a credits page.

* Themes also have asset files, like CSS files. They will also be baked with the
  website, unless a file with the exact same relative path exists in the
  website, in which case the theme file will be "eclipsed".


> #### The built-in theme
> 
> By default, **PieCrust** applies a theme called "Built-in", which provides a
> simple layout and style. It only has a `default` and `post` layouts, and some
> implementation for the `_index`, `_tag`, and `_category` pages.
