title: Limitations and workarounds

**PieCrust** is great for simple websites and blogs, but like every other static
website generator, it has some limitations. Only static content is supported
(duh!), but most dynamic content requiring server-side processing is not within
**PieCrust**'s scope anyway (user accounts, access permissions, etc.). For this,
you should look into a proper CMS engine like [WordPress][], [Drupal][] or
[Orchard][].

It doesn't mean that **PieCrust** website can't pack some whistles and bells
like any other website, however!

* If you want dynamic content like displaying [Flickr][] pictures or [Twitter][]
  feeds, you can use client-side scripting.
* If you want users to be able to comment on, rate, and share your pages, you
  can use 3rd party services like [Disqus][].
* If you want to cross-post to [Twitter][] or [Facebook][], you can do that
  _via_ an RSS feed.
