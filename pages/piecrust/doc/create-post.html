Creating a blog post is a lot like [creating a page][1], only you create the
text file in the `posts` folder instead of `pages`.

### Naming conventions

There are 3 ways of organizing the `posts` folder: `flat`, `shallow` or
`hierarchical`. By default **PieCrust** uses the `flat` mode. You can change the
mode in the [site configuration][2] using the `site/posts_fs` setting.


#### Flat organization

In `flat` mode, all blog posts are HTML files in the `posts` folder that follow
this naming convention:

    <year>-<month>-<day>_<slug>.html

Here's an example:

    posts
     |- 2010-08-23_why-i-love-bacon.html

By default, that article would be accessible at
`http://domain.com/2010/08/23/why-i-love-bacon`, although you can also change
the URL format of blog posts in the [site configuration][2].

This organization is good for blogs that don't have a lot of updates.


#### Shallow organization

In `shallow` mode, the `posts` folder has sub-folders for each year, and those
have all the posts for that year using the following convention:

    <year>/<month>-<day>_<slug>.html

For example:

    posts
     |- 2010
         |- 08-23_why-i-love-bacon.html

This organization is good for blogs with only a couple updates per month.


#### Hierarchical organization

In `hierarchical` mode, the year and month of a blog post are specified by the
sub-folders in which they reside:

    <year>/<month>/<day>_<slug>.html

For example:

    posts
     |- 2010
         |- 08
             |- 23_why-i-love-bacon.html

This organization is good for blogs with quite a lot of articles.


### Page breaks

When a page displays a list of blog posts, you sometimes don't want to put the
complete posts texts in there -- instead, you only want the introduction of the
post to be used. You can "cut" a post in two by inserting one of the "page
break" tags:

    <!-- more -->
    <!-- break -->
    <!-- pagebreak -->

Any of these tags would tell the pagination system to only take whatever comes
before that tag when a post is shown in a list. See the [pagination
documentation][5] for more info.


### Configuration values

In addition to the [usual page configuration values][3], blog posts can define a
few useful things:

* `layout`: This is used the same as for a page, but **PieCrust** will use a 
  default layout called `post` instead of `default` if it exists.

* `time`: Use this to specify a time of day for when the post was written (e.g.
  "12:45:02"). **PieCrust** will use it to expose the correct `date` and
  `timestamp` variables to the template engine.

* `tags`: Use this to add tags to a post, so that it appears in [tag
  listings][4]. This should be an array, like so: `tags: [ food, cooking, fun
  ]`.

* `category`: Use this to put this post into one category, so that it appears in
  [category listings][4].

Other useful variables to define are `author` or `summary`, although
**PieCrust** wouldn't do anything special with those -- it's just that they
would be commonly used by pages showing those posts.
