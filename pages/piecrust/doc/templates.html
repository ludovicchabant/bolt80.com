**PieCrust** makes all your pages and layouts go through a _templating_ stage.

By default, the template engine is [Twig], and all the examples found in this
documentation are using the **Twig** syntax.

* If you want to use a [different default engine][5], change the
  `default_template_engine` setting in the [site configuration][1].

* If you want just a specific layout file to use a different template engine,
  change its file extension from `html` to the name of the engine you want (see
  the available [template engines][5]). Remember that pages will have to
  [specify that layout with the extension][6].

* If you want a page itself to use a different template engine, set the
  `template_engine` configuration setting for that page to the name of the
  engine you want. Available template engines are listed in the [template
  engines list][5].



### Writing a layout template

Templates are text files placed in the `_content/templates` folder. They usually
have the `html` file extension if they're written using the default template
engine's syntax -- otherwise, they need to have a file extension that matches
the engine they should be processed with (see the [available engine names][5]).

In its most basic form, a layout template would look like this:

{% geshi 'html' %}{% raw %}
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            {{ content|raw }}
        </body>
    </html>
{% endraw %}{% endgeshi %}

This creates an HTML page whose title and contents are the title and contents of
the **PieCrust** page being rendered. This is possible because the `page.title`
and `content` variables are exposed to the template engine. A lot of other
variables are available (see the "_Template variables_" section below).



### Page templating

Pages go through the templating stage before having their contents
[formatted][8]. This means that template syntax (variables, loops, etc) are
available not only in layout files, but also in pages. This is especially useful
when a page needs to display a list of blog posts, for instance.



### Template variables

Here's how **PieCrust** exposes variables to the template engine.

In pages:

* The page's [configuration settings][2] (from the page's YAML header) are
  exposed directly.
* The page's [assets][3] and [pagination][4] are exposed through the `assets` and
  `pagination` variables.
* The site's [configuration settings][1] (from the `_content/config.yml` file)
  are exposed directly. This means that the `site` variable exposes the settings
  found in the `site` section of the site's configuration. The `custom` variable
  would expose any setting found in the `custom` section.
* The [blog archives][10] are available through the `blog` variable -- unless you have [multiple blogs][11], in which case they are exposed through the name of each blog (so if you named your blogs `artblog` and `cookingblog`, each blog's archives would be exposed through variables `artblog` and `cookingblog` respectively).

In layouts:

* The page's formatted contents are exposed in the `content` variable. Other
  [content segments][9] are exposed directly with their name too.
* The page's [configuration settings][2] (from the page's YAML header) are
  exposed through the `page` variable.
* The site's [configuration settings][1] (from the `_content/config.yml` file)
  are exposed directly (see above).
* The [blog archives][10] are available the same way as in pages (see above).

A few system variables are always exposed:

* `piecrust.version` contains the current version of the engine.
* `piecrust.branding` contains a short text proudly telling the world how your
  site runs with **PieCrust** (_you can see that text right now at the bottom of
  this page!_).
* `piecrust.debug_info` shows a list of available template variables on the
  current page, along with their values, if the debugging mode is turned on.
  This is called the [debug window][7].


    
### Sharing templates

You may not want to have all your templates in the `_content/templates` folder
-- _e.g._ you may want to share some templates with other websites. In that
case, you can put some templates in other folders, including folders outside of
your website's root folder.

You can specify your custom templates folders with the `site/templates_dirs`
[configuration setting][1]. Paths can be written relative to the website's root:

    site:
        templates_dirs:
            - ../shared/templates
            - ../framework/templates
