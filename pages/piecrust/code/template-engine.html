title: Adding a template engine
layout: piecrust_code
---

To add a new template engine to **PieCrust**, override the `getTemplateEngines` method in your plugin and return a new instance of a class implementing the `PieCrust\TemplateEngines\ITemplateEngine` interface.

### The ITemplateEngine interface

The interface has the following methods:

* `initialize`: This is called when the website is loaded, with a chance for your template engine to get hold of the `PieCrust` instance. Because this is always called, you should only do cheap stuff in this method. Generally speaking, you should only query a few configuration settings from the application object or, better, just store a reference to it for later use. Delay as much as possible until your template engine is actually used.

* `getExtension`: This should return the file extension to use to select this template
engine.

* `renderString`: This should render the given string template with the given template data. The rendered page should be printed to the standard output.

* `renderFile`: This is the same as `renderString` except that the first parameter is the name of the template. Some template engines already have their own file locating system, so as long as those engines are correctly initialized with the application's template paths (`$this->pieCrust->getTemplatesDir()`), everything should work fine.

* `clearInternalCache`: This is a method that gets called in between requests in
  the development server (`chef serve`). This is because some template engines
  store static data, expecting it all to be re-created in between requests in a
  proper web server. Most of the time, you don't need to do anything in the
  method.

### Example

{% geshi 'php' %}
use PieCrust\PieCrust;
use PieCrust\TemplateEngines;

class MyAwesomeTemplateEngine implements ITemplateEngine
{
	protected $pieCrust;
	
	public function initialize(PieCrust $pieCrust)
    {
        // Initialize the template engine.
		$this->pieCrust = $pieCrust;
    }
	
	public function getExtension()
	{
        // Get the file extension for templates using this engine.
		return 'awesome';
	}
	
	public function renderString($content, $data)
	{
        // Render the given string and data.
        echo SomeLib::render($content, $data);
	}
	
	public function renderFile($templateName, $data)
	{
		// Get the actual template file's path.
		$templatePath = \PieCrust\Util\PathHelper::getTemplatePath(
            $this->pieCrust,
            $templateName
        );
        
        // Render the file's contents
		$content = file_get_contents($templatePath);
		echo SomeLib::render($content, $data);
	}
	
	public function clearInternalCache()
	{
	}
}

{% endgeshi %}


### Testing 

To test your template engine:

1. Create a template file called `my-test.awesome` in `_content/templates`.
1. Create a page that specifies `my-test.awesome` as its layout.
