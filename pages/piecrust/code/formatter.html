title: Adding a formatter
layout: piecrust_code

To add a new text formatter to **PieCrust**, override the `getFormatters` method in your plugin and return a new instance of a class implementing the `PieCrust\Formatters\IFormatter` interface.

### The IFormatter interface

The interface has the following methods:

* `initialize`: This is called when the website is loaded, with a chance for your formatter to get hold of the `PieCrust` instance. Because this is always called, you should only do cheap stuff in this method. Generally speaking, you should only query a few configuration settings from the application object or, better, just store a reference to it for later use. Delay as much as possible until your formatter is actually used.

* `getPriority`: Formatters are asked in order of priority whether they want to support a format. There are only 3 priorities so far (high, default and low). The **SmartyPants** and _pass-through_ formatters have low priorities. All the other ones have default priority.

* `supportsFormat`: This function should obviously return `true` if the text should be processed by this formatter. The name of the requested format is given as the first parameter. Usually, you want to only process unformatted text so check the `isUnformatted` flag (**SmartPants** is an exception, since it adds more formatting on top of other formattings).

* `format` : This function should do all the expensive stuff -- not only format the text, of course, but also include and load any needed external libraries. For example, you should avoid including external PHP scripts until you know this formatter is going to be used.


### Example

{% geshi 'php' %}
use PieCrust\PieCrust;
use PieCrust\Formatters\IFormatter;

class MyAwesomeFormatter implements IFormatter
{
    protected $pieCrust;
    
    public function initialize(PieCrust $pieCrust)
    {
        // Initialize the formatter.
        $this->pieCrust = $pieCrust;
    }
    
    public function getPriority()
    {
        // Return the priority (high, default or low).
        return IFormatter::PRIORITY_DEFAULT;
    }
    
    public function supportsFormat($format, $isUnformatted)
    {
        // Return whether you want to support the given format
        return $isUnformatted && ($format == "awesome");
    }
    
    public function format($text)
    {
        // Here, actually for the formatting and all the
        // expensive stuff.
        require_once 'my-external-lib.php';
        return ExternalLib::doStuff($text);
    }
}
{% endgeshi %}


### Testing the formatter

To test your formatter, just create a page that specifies `awesome` (or whatever string you're matching in `supportsFormat`) as its format.
