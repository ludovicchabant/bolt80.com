**StupidHttp** starts with the `StupidHttp_WebServer` class which obviously represents the web server. You pass it the path to the document root (or `null` if you don't intend to serve files from your disk), the port to serve from (the default is `8080`), and the address (the default is `localhost`).

{% geshi 'php' %}
    $server = new StupidHttp_WebServer('/path/to/document/root', 8080, 'localhost');
{% endgeshi %}

You can then set request handlers in the form of callback functions. Such callbacks can be triggered by a URL to match, or by a regular expression pattern:

{% geshi 'php' %}
    // Say hello when the website root is accessed.
    $server->on('GET', '/')
           ->call(function($c) { echo 'Hello from StupidHttp!'; });
           
    // Say hello to any name specified in the URL using regular expression matching.
    $server->onPattern('GET', '/hello/(.+)')
           ->call(function($c, $m) { echo 'Hello, ' . $m[1]; });
    $server->run();
{% endgeshi %}

Callbacks must be:

* Callable objects (functions, etc.)
* Take a first parameter that will receive the `context` of the request (more on this later).
* If the request was matched from a regular expression with capture groups, take a second parameter which is the array of those groups (as returned by `preg_match`).

Whatever is printed to the standard output from the callback will be sent to the client browser as the response body.

The `context` parameter is of type `StupidHttp_HandlerContext` and lets you access various things like the HTTP request, the HTTP response (where you can set custom headers), and the log. For more information on those types, see the [API documentation]({{ site.root }}stupidhttp/api_doc/html/).


Server options
--------------

The `StupidHttp_WebServer::run` function can take options as an associative array:

* `list_directories` (default: `true`): if a request maps to an existing directory, a listing of the directory's contents will be returned to the browser. If set to `false`, the server will instead fall through to the request handlers.
* `list_root_directory` (default: `false`): the `/` request would usually list the root directory's contents unless an `index.html` file is present. This is `false` by default so the request handlers are called instead.
* `run_browser` (default: `false`): Runs the default browser after the server is started.
